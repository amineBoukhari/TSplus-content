In the late 2010s, flexible work arrangements were already on the rise, if slowly. 2020 supercharged that with the pandemic creating a mass exodus of workers from the corporate office to the home office. Remote working became the word of the day. But the question from the beginning was often 'What happens next?'. Well, how about keeping [remote work](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/) - hybrid working solutions are here to stay!


## Hybrid Working as a Solution


For a lot of companies, that question was answered with hybrid working at the time of all the lock-downs. But while certain companies embraced the new trend, others went there under duress and jumped straight back out as soon as they could. Nonetheless, a few days in the office, balanced by a few days working from home each week, has become a new norm.


This offers employees the flexibility they have come to expect, while keeping the in-person vibe so crucial to cohesion of working teams. Hybrid working presents its own challenges. Yet, it also offers unique opportunities for day-to-day concerns ranging from staffing to data security and integrity.


## Hybrid Working Solutions to Reconcile Companies with Remote Work


When many companies scattered their staff to the safety of the home office. That left thousands of empty offices and millions of unattended workstations sitting idle. The added cost of mobile devices and supplies for remote workers was too much for some. It was often impractical to bear another large expenditure to accommodate yet another evolution of working conditions.


With businesses and corporations alike still struggling to balance all these variables, one solution has risen to the top – [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/).
