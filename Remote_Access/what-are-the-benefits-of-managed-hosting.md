When an individual first begins to create web pages on the internet for their company or to start a business, one of the issues that will arise is how to host the website. There are several options available, but the one that many businesses choose is managed hosting. Companies choose managed hosting for a variety of reasons. Let's have a look at some of the many benefits to managed hosting that make it a very attractive option for many.
There are a number of providers that offer managed hosting. Generally, the fees for each can vary considerably due to the features and options that the company provides. So, what are the benefits of managed hosting?


## Benefit of Managed Hosting - Strength in Numbers Cause Spread Costs to Be Lower


One of the biggest benefits of managed hosting is the price of the service. A large proportion of companies that offer managed hosting can offer services and bandwidth at a much lower price than many businesses may be able to obtain on their own. This is because the cost and the amount of available bandwidth is spread among large numbers of clients. Some of these may need a relatively small amount of bandwidth to operate their websites and others much more, but that common pool means cost is spread.


## Shared Managed Hosting and Dedicated Servers as a Benefit of Managed Hosting


Using managed hosting also saves each individual business from having to purchase and maintain additional equipment in order to host their websites. This includes servers and networking software. Some managed hosting companies will also allow businesses to place their website on a dedicated server for a higher monthly or annual fee. This option is commonly chosen by companies that need a great amount of bandwidth for their sites to run effectively.


## Additional Features Increase Benefits of Managed Hosting for Customers


There is another reason that many individuals find managed hosting to be an attractive option. That is because of the additional features that are included in the service package. Many managed hosting companies offer the individuals using their service increased security and monitoring services that prevent a host of issues. Type of problems curtailed by the provider can range from the spread of viruses to unauthorized access to the stealing of customerâ€™s personal information.


Purchasing security software and equipment to constantly monitor for these issues can be costly for the average consumers. Yet managed hosting companies can provide these services at a fraction of the costs since it is split between many.


## Final Benefit of Managed Hosting: Constant Power Supply Plus Back-up Facilities


Managed hosting companies can also provide an uninterrupted power supply and data backup features to ensure that the website will run smoothly and without interruption for a vast majority of the time. In fact, many of these companies can provide an average up time of better than 95%. This is practically unachievable if the business is hosting the website themselves. Indeed, housing a generator on business premises is not a possibility open to all.


## Monitoring Servers Benefits Both Self-Hosted and Managed Hosting
