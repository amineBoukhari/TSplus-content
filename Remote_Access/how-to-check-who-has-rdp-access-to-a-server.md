As a network administrator, you probably have a whole lists of tasks. One of these will have to be to oversee RDP access to your servers. For that you need to know how to check who has RDP access to a server. Is it as straightforward task? What does checking user RDP access entail? We will look at all that before seeing [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/) at work and any correlated tasks and possibilities.
## RDP User Management in Windows - Some Examples of Tasks


Managing RDP users in Windows or other remote software or services, some tasks are recurrent. Creating users and then granting them appropriate permissions go as a pair. Then you have the checks in question today. Making sure each user has the access permissions they need to complete their daily work also figures on the list.


These are one tip of an iceberg as complex as your network. Some days will go smoothly. Other days, it’s components, devices and apps, the number of staff and users accessing it, and any other variable that might weigh in and multiply potentials, all come together for something quirky to happen.


## Checking Who has RDP Access to a Server in Windows


Time to get down to business. Start by accessing the device’s local “Computer Management” via a right click on the start menu. In that window, you can scroll down the side menu within “System Tools”. Expand “Local Users and Groups” and click to access the “Groups” list. Here, you should find all the information you need.


In the group “Remote Desktop Users”, those users listed will have been allocated access privileges. “Administrators” on the other hand should each by default have access to a device. Bear in mind that administrators may not automatically be listed in their group while nonetheless normally being granted default access.


## Alternative for Checking Who Has RDP Access to a Server


Windows proprietary software is useful and functions yet we saw the need for something different and simpler. TSplus Remote Access provides you with a complete management console for all your [application publishing and Web-enabling](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#shared-remote-desktop), for your user profiles and presence management, even for your farm management, amongst other things. Here is how you would perform the above checks in our environment.


## Checking Who has RDP Access to a Server in Remote Access


To perform the above checks when using TSplus Remote Access, you can look in the same places as above for the device-based information. You can manage a host of user-related assignments in the "Publish & Assign Applications" settings in Lite mode and the "Application" preferences in Expert mode. On the Home display of the Expert mode, you will see this:

Click on the “Session Manager” button to view a list of users. As you can see, the “User Sessions” pane contains basic information for each user, including whether they are active of not. You can actually select any one and impact it with an action of your choice amongst the buttons below the table: Remote Control, Disconnect, Logoff, Send Message or [open] Task Manager.

There are extra RDP specific permissions in the "Sessions>Permissions" pane. To test them, you can [download a 15-day trial version of Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/download/).

## Further Possibilities within TSplus Remote Access

Within the Sessions menu, you can perform other user-related tasks such as set a session time limit (ie, how long a disconnected session is left until terminated) and User Reconnection options (Here, users can be allowed one unique session or multiple sessions. A session can be captured so the user connects to the same session each time, or the previous will be terminated and a new one opened.)


Session Prelaunch is a feature of which we are particularly proud. Indeed, it enables you to set user sessions to launch in advance or usual work-hours for each user or group. This way, when the user connects, there is no latency whatsoever as their session is already up and waiting for them. This will account to smoother starts to your users' workdays.


To finish, here is the Remote Access “Permissions” pane:

Setting any of the features you see with care is worthwhile to increase security for your server. Permissions can restrict access to both or one of the categories of users we have mentioned: all users or admin only. Also, it can be brought right down to LAN users alone or no incoming access whatsoever.
