**Simple - Affordable - Efficient - Secure**


Remote Access from 32$ per user. For life.


It’s as simple as that.

## Remote Access - Affordable


[TSplus](https://tsplus.net/) has been developing simple, secure, efficient and, most interestingly, affordable remote access software for over a decade and is not set to stop. Could it be due to the satisfaction of making available to everyone what was for a long time reserved to the largest and richest?


## Remote Access Alternative Without the Price Tag and Learning Curve


Many software developers or resellers can claim a share of the distant working or application publication markets. Yet, few can rightly claim to being the cheapest while still being as good as some of the biggest. That is central to the TSplus mindset and has paved the road daily for company staff worldwide.


## Remote Access With End-to-end Encryption


The most important tools to use TSplus software are the Internet, HTML5 and a Web browser. Because of this, TSplus Remote Access communications are end-to-end encrypted and rely amongst other things on SSL certificates for basic security.


Nevertheless, the threats of this day and age cannot be easily ignored and TSplus developers have made sure users have the option of 2FA. This will improve any user’s peace of mind. Our teams have also crafted TSplus Advanced Security as an additional product for all-round cyber-protection.


## Simple Application Publishing and Remote Desktop Access


So, what does TSplus Remote Access offer that makes it proudly take on such a challenge? TSplus Remote Access is primarily application publication software. It is a simple yet versatile tool that can make all or parts of almost any PC available from a distance simply by using native Microsoft RDP. Within a few clicks, you can use a legacy Windows app on your smartphone or tablet or work on your remote desktop as though it were inside your laptop or other device.


## Possibilities and Potential with TSplus Remote Access


There are all kind of reasons you may want to do that. Here are a few!


* Keep using that software which you know so well and for which you need no training while still gaining the mobility of doing so from anywhere.
* Access memory-heavy apps on a light device which hasn’t the RAM it would otherwise need.
* Make applications available to a whole staff team or sets of workplaces without needing to install them on as many machines or in so many places. (And less installation implies less upkeep!)
* Create your own SaaS solution, host and manage it.
* Make any desktop PC and all its files fit in a back pocket or handbag. It can be accessed when travelling for work or holiday or taken home.
* Use Windows-specific software on Mac as though it were a native application.
* Lighten the IT workload and budget without cutting down on staff or quality.


## High Potential User-Friendly Remote Access


Whichever way you take it, it is likely this price won’t be a cause of slow business development. And the best thing is that with barely any technical knowledge, most of these ideas are within reach thanks to the simplicity and user-friendliness of the Admin Console.


Be it publishing applications to the Web or user set-up, for example, the steps are pretty much self-explanatory. Although you can find just about any actions you may need to carry out detailed in the Quick-Start Guide or in the User Guide. And should you ever need exterior help, our highly responsive Support and Sales teams are amongst the best rated in the market.
