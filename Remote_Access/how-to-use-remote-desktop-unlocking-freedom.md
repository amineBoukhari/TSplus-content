TSplus empowers you to break free of physical location, enabling you to harness the full potential of your IT resources while on the move. In this guide, we will first walk you through the steps of setting up and starting to use TSplus Remote Access.


Now, this is a new take on a topic I covered some months ago [here](https://tsplus.net/remote-work/blog/how-to-use-remote-desktop/). From a Remote Access point of view, there remained more to say. With that in mind, our next step will be to put the emphasis on this software's remarkable capabilities to keep you productive, no matter where you are. Or, to paraphrase: “how to *make use of* TSplus Remote Access for your desktops” to show off some of its potential.


So, let us dive into the world of TSplus and discover how you can maximise your efficiency and work from anywhere with ease.


## How To Use Remote Desktop Functionality? Follow These Steps:


1. #### Access TSplus Remote Access:


First, ensure you have TSplus Remote Access [installed and configured on your system](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/installation/). If you haven't installed it already, you can obtain our software from our website. You can buy directly or use the trial period to test it for free.
2. #### Launch the TSplus Client:


Open the TSplus client application on your computer. This client software allows you to connect to remote desktops and applications.
3. #### Enter Connexion Details:


You will typically need to enter the following details:


	* **Server Address:** Input the IP address or hostname of the remote server you want to connect to.
	* **Username and Password:** Provide your credentials to authenticate yourself on the remote server.
4. #### Select Remote Desktop or Application:


Depending on your requirements, you may choose to connect to a full remote desktop or only specific applications published through TSplus. Also, you may allow or disallow specific users certain actions or accesses.


The management console enables administration of authorisations and access in relation to users and groups, amongst other parameters.
5. #### Connect:


Click the "Connect" or "Login" button to establish a remote connexion.
6. #### Remote Desktop Session:


If you selected a full remote desktop, you now have access to the remote computer as though you were physically present in front of it. Indeed, you can run applications, access files and perform tasks, just as you would on a local desktop.
7. #### Disconnect:


When you're done with your remote session, ensure you log off or disconnect properly to ensure security.
