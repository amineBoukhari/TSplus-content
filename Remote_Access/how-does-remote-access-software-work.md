Remote access software allows users to access and control a computer or device from a different device in a different location. Remote access technology is commonly used for various purposes, such as providing technical support, collaborating on projects or accessing files and applications on a remote machine.

If your question is “how does remote access software work”, this article is the right read. We will take a look at that followed by some highlights of how our affordable [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/) empowers your company to web-enable applications and provide remote desktops and environments, simply and securely.
## Here is a general overview of how remote access software works:


### 1. Installation and Configuration:


* Both the host (remote computer to be accessed) and the client (local computer initiating the remote access) need to have the remote access software installed which will use the native RDP. You can download software such from a provider's website ([such as ours](https://tsplus.net/download/)) or install it through other methods (USB, etc.).


### 2. Establishing Remote Access Connexions:


* The client computer initiates a connexion request to the host computer. Therefore, this request usually involves inputting a unique identifier or IP address associated with the host machine.
* Increasingly, you will establish secure connexions which use encryption protocols (such as SSL/TLS). This ensures the privacy and security of the data being transmitted.


### 3. Authentication and Authorisation:


* The host computer's remote access software verifies the connexion request. This step often involves user authentication, where the client needs to provide valid credentials (username and password) or other forms of authentication (such as two-factor authentication) to gain access.
* Authentication complete, the software determines the level of access of the user, which could range from viewing-only access to full control of the host machine.


### 4. Data Transmission and Encryption:


* Any data transmitted between the client and host computers, including screen images and input commands, is typically encrypted to ensure security and privacy. This prevents unauthorised interception and access.


### 5. How to Terminate Remote Access Connexions:


* Finally, when the remote session is complete, the client can choose to disconnect from the host computer. Alternatively, the host user can also terminate the session.


## Additional Specifics of How Remote Access Software Works


Here are a few more specific aspects of the way remote access functions.


### "Replication" of the User Interface:


* The remote access software displays or in other words "replicates" the host computer's screen on the client device. This, hence, allows the remote user to see and control in real time exactly what is happening on the screen of the host machine.
* Depending on the software, what is displayed might include the entire desktop with or without its file system, or one or more specific applications in their own floating windows, or whatever administrators parameter for the user.


### Input and Control:


* The client can interact with the host computer as with a local device. The remote access software sends the input commands through its interface. Inputs include actions such as clicking, typing, dragging and scrolling.
* The software then transmits these input commands to the host machine in real time. In turn, the host device processes them as though they were entered directly using the its physical keyboard, mouse or other.


### How Does Remote Access Software Work: An Important Security Note:


While remote access software is incredibly useful, it also poses security risks. Unauthorised access to a computer can lead to data breaches and privacy violations. Therefore, it is essential to follow best practice guidelines, such as using strong passwords, making sure TLS/SSL type encryption are active and keeping software up to date.
