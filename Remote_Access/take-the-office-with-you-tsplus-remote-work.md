**The problem with business travel, to put it bluntly, is that you are not in your office. If you are a manager or a project leader, your still need to stay in touch with your team and what is going on at all times. Continuity is crucial.**
## Never Completely Out of Touch


It could seem that this need is at cross-purposes with the idea of business travel. But don’t worry, with modern technology and a bit of coordination on your part, you can maintain a reasonable level of connectivity to your important projects and team activities even while driving in the rental car or waiting out a flight at the airport.


## Remote Work Tools and Team Communication Software


The actual technology you use to stay connected may change over time. Whereas in the past we could only use pay phones at airports, we have evolved technologically so you can travel and access your network via your cell phone, wireless PC or an assortment of other devices. This said, you will need to put two essentials into place.


The first thing you will need is a way to stay in touch with your team cheaply and easily. If you want more than simple phone calls, you probably already have some favourite apps to do this. There are a bounty of possibilities at hand. Maybe we’ll touch on those applications another time.


The second thing you will need is a tool to keep your office workstation and company data at your fingertips come what may. That is our field: the field of remote desktops and distant working. So, this is where we step in with [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/), software to make your desktop available from anywhere on any device, even with low Internet bandwidths.


## Connect to Work Remotely and Take Your Office Wherever You Go


An important step is to identify which type of technology satisfies your need for connectivity as well as enabling you to work productively in diverse locations such as the airport, your airplane seat or your hotel room. Here, I’m referring to the laptop, tablet and/or smartphone you plan to use when accessing your desktop remotely while working away.


Of course, that is up to you. Especially since TSplus Remote Access can connects using [our built-in customisable Web Portal](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#connection-modes). This leaves you total freedom of which device you prefer but also which OS you would like to use. You can even have more than one favourite as long as you have an Internet browser in each.


## Equipment Strong Enough for Travelling


Depending on where and why you are traveling, this could require a little more care and attention. As you conduct a technical review of the available technology, be careful to research the durability of the equipment you are taking on the road. You may be able to afford the most sophisticated equipment on the market today.


But is that equipment going to survive the rigors of travel? Indeed, travelling could include you High-Tech devices being banged around in your luggage, exposed to heat, cold and moisture or just about any other harsh condition you might throw them into? If it isn’t, then it isn’t going to be the kind of equipment you want by your side on a long business trip.


## Hardware and Internet Connectivity to Take Your Office Globetrotting


Once you have settled on the equipment, you can check how it is configured. Make sure you are all set for internet access as well as the ability to tap into your corporate intranet and network. This is crucial so that you can communicate with your team and access corporate files to stay on top of what is going on with your projects back at the office.


Something to remember if you want to back-up wireless connectivity with a cable, is to check plugs and sockets on your cables and devices as well as what will be available locally since they will need to be compatible.


## Hardware Internet Connectivity for a Global Office


Once you have settled on the equipment, you can check how it is configured. Make sure you are all set for internet access as well as the ability to tap into your corporate intranet and network. This is crucial so that you can communicate with your team and access corporate files to stay on top of what is going on with your projects back at the office.


For example, if your project team file their status reports each Friday morning, you must be able to review those. Then, you will most likely want to give your team directions for any further action. So, you need to be able to communicate with them those items on which they need to work deriving from those reports.


You will generally need to do this quickly and efficiently, even if you are on a ten-hour flight from Europe. Hence the need for connectivity hardware powerful enough and technology modern enough to be rapid and efficient.


## Mobile Internet Connectivity for Versatile Remote Access


Nowadays, making sure you can access the Internet is often as simple as checking with your mobile provider that your data is activated.

There are also more and more shared office facilities in cities around the globe. These offer you even more potential to easily stay connected to your office while travelling.


## Out-of-Office or Transferred Calls


To manage your phone contacts, one reflex can involve just putting the “out of office” auto-answer on your office message service. Instead, you could ask admin to forward your office phone-line to your cell phone and receive your phone calls in remote. This will enable you to conduct your business as though you were on site throughout your trip. Additionally, remember all those communication applications mentioned in passing. They open a world of possibilities.
