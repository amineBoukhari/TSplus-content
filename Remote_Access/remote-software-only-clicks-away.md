## Remote Access


Remote access programs are useful and efficient in a great many ways. The main focus of this technology is basically to make the office accessible from anywhere that has an internet connection. **Our tools to illustrate this are [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/), which enables application publication and makes your apps accessible from pretty much any device, and [TSplus Remote Work](https://tsplus.net/remote-work/), which offers employees a take-away office workstation, in all simplicity. And in a different field, there is [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/), which enables screen control and much more.**## Remote Software Uses


These days the line between work and home are blurring. While some employees finish their work at home and end up working longer hours than ever per week, others simply work remotely for organizational reasons. This is where remote software comes in. It allows employees to work as though they were in the office, from wherever they are.


## Remotely Access Desktops and Files from Anywhere


You may want to transfer files between your laptop and office PC. You might need to access a file left behind on your desktop computer. You could be on call and need to refer to documents in your office IT system. Or perhaps you need to access company resources and applications on a local area network or elsewhere. Remote access programs are the solution to your queries and problems.


## Remote Access for Employees, Administrators and Support Staff On-the-Go!


Remote access programs, from application publishing software to file transfer utilities, remote servers to remote-control software, are specially designed for those people who need remote access to the office network and resources or to specific machines.


## Remote Access to Local, Distant and Cloud Data


File-transfer utilities are inexpensive, easy-to-use packages that allow local or remote users to move even the largest files directly to and from any PC's hard drive or other devices as long as they are connected via Internet or networked via a cable or Wi-Fi. There is also the option of keeping everything out in the Cloud. This does away with the need to transfer anything since it is available from any device with a connection.


## Affordable and Scalable Remote Access Software


Some products are designed for small branch offices searching for an affordable, simple remote access solution. For larger companies, choices and bundles are available to scale up and extend the set-up according to the client’s specifications.


## Remote Control Software for your Support Team


Remote-control software, such as GoToMyPC allows the user to control the computer that’s sitting in the office as if they were sitting in front of it. It opens up a browser window that displays the desktop screen of the host computer. The host computer may also hand over the control of the mouse and keyboard to the remote user for them to perform specific tasks. Handing off the controls will enable the remote user to manipulate the mouse and keyboard of the host computer as though they were their own.


This type of control saves your technicians the time and hassle of going to the remote user's location to make configuration changes. It also frees your support team to deal with issues on any device around the Globe. What’s more, they can even collaborate by inviting a colleague into the chat should the need arise. This may also be done for demonstration purposes if several people need to see a particular set of steps being carried out.


## Safe and Secure Remote Software


Whatever the task at hand, using remote software makes life a lot easier when outside the office. The main drawback of remote software is variety of potential security issues. Good remote software will allow full control to the authorized user but at the same time make sure un-authorized users do not have access. Our products are built with the safety and confidentiality of our users and their data in mind.
