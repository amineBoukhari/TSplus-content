Application service providers have quickly sprouted onto the web hosting scene in an effort to provide businesses with new and innovative services. Here’s what and how as well as some tools for the job. I’ll use the acronym ASP for this article but be mindful, elsewhere, there are quite a few possible confusions for those three letters.
## What are Application Service Providers and Hosting?


They are companies, basically a third party, who will provide access to applications on what amounts to a rental basis. The service extends to the servers, websites, etc. that make up the network and more according to what offer the ASP decides to put on offer.


As remotely-hosted applications can provide cost-effective access for businesses to unique software, many of the applications are designed to be of occasional use in terms of use. Others are geared towards using group connectivity provided through the Internet to offer an application that is flexible.


## Application Service Providers for All Fields and Industries


The number of applications and services provided through the ASP model is growing. Accordingly, there is a growing number of companies developing software for the ASP marketplace. What sorts of applications are being developed?


ASPs have created software programs to handle various business functions like materials management, human resources, financial management, and e-commerce transaction services.


## Application Service Providers Host Software on Subscription


A major advantage for businesses seeking ASP services is that they provide an opportunity to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Companies can often have access to a wider-range of software products with the possibility of paying less than an outright purchase. The cost is spread through usage charges. This allows businesses to access applications that can service particular business needs so companies can focus on their core operations.


## Developing to Provide Better Application Services


Furthermore, ASPs are developing new software that can provide business solutions to operating issues not previously addressed through PC-based software. They also remove many of the technical administrative and maintenance issues associated with software by providing real-time upgrades, remote hosting, remote dial-in customer support and overall software management.


## Network Management and other Application Services Provided


Web hosting companies are involved in the development of applications – however, many of the hosting companies serve to provide network management and serve the application remotely to users. In providing ASP-related services, these companies are essentially application infrastructure providers.


## Application


For mainframe web hosting applications, ASP service providers are pioneering a new way to host and maintain business applications. These companies save businesses the trouble of having an in-house IT team or needing to take care of the infrastructure or organisation the network would otherwise entail. Instead, businesses can entrust all this and more to the ASP and get on with what they do best: their line of business.
