## Security Issues with Native RDP


Native RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) comes with security concerns. When you enable remote desktop, you open a port that can be visible to your local network. It is therefore crucial to restrict access to trusted networks only, as well as ensure strong passwords for all accounts with access.


Additionally, consider whether or not to enable Network Level Authentication (NLA). It adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to authenticate themselves before connecting and so helps protect against certain malicious attacks. But it also causes particular constraints which you may prefer to avoid.
