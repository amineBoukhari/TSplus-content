When companies have legacy applications, there always comes a time for choosing. Choosing to replace them with something more modern, at what cost? Choosing to keep them in some shape or form: why and how? [TSplus Remote Access](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/) is a tool for maximising legacy business applications.
## Assets Companies Can Forget: Legacy Business Applications


Since the generalisation of IT, companies have invested in a combination of software applications and hardware. This has enabled some to soar economically, technologically or as a brand. Thus, fast innovations in IT have changed the face of business. In addition, expectations, as well as service requirements, have evolved. IT infrastructure can be extremely contrasted from one company to the next.


## For Maximising, Legacy Business Applications Meet the Web


Some businesses have standard or tailor-made legacy software application. Meanwhile, others have opted for open-build applications utilizing the Web and its possibilities. Therefore, despite others considering them obsolete and re-investing, some companies are still greatly reliant on legacy software programs.


Consider an ancient castle, built from solid material, with great craftsmanship and design. It may raise no interest in some, while to others it could be essential, ideal. In certain contexts, throwing away to begin from scratch make no sense. So, to meet the needs of tomorrow's businesses, why not [re-deploy legacy builds](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#shared-remote-desktop) while reworking how things are administrated? This is a key for rapid and affordable maximisation of current IT assets.


## What is a Legacy Application?


Legacy applications are the fruit of a use of manpower and IT potential that made financial sense at the time. Indeed, budgets and teams looked very different one, two or three decades ago. Companies could have in-house developers creating and adapting tools and ideas to their structure and requirements. Over time, some companies have entirely moved away from this, choosing main-stream generic software. Some might say they have moved with their times, as legacy could basically be nick-named ageing.


On the other hand, a legacy set-up will be made up of applications operating on mainframes or mid-range systems. These then access and process extensive data managed by internal (also potentially legacy) database, logistics, machinery or other software. It is likely such made-to-measure software has no available equivalent to replace it. There is no way for certain companies to feasibly move away from their old applications. Yet, the question of compatibility and upkeep remains.


## A Status Quo of Legacy Software


As it stands, legacy applications frequently carry the following set of obstacles: use, maintenance, compatibility.


* They were usually built for in-house use, specific purposes, a company need that is niche rather than wide-spread.
* Legacy software needs complementary functions that can only be added by technical teams. As mobility and time take their toll, new staff may lack the information, skill or time needed to carry on their predecessors’ work. This can unfortunately lead to unpredictability, crashes, part of the system breaking down, etc.
* Their specificity is often counterbalanced by the company’s need to be part of a global market. Businesses have to use the Internet for administrative and financial tasks, to enable remote-work and more.
* Legacy applications are known and used by company teams and potentially also customers. The cost of replacing them would involve much more than the cost of the appropriate new software. There are time and training costs, both where transferring and setting up is concerned and where use and adaptation come into play.
* New software can cause issues where old tried-and-tested applications have been tamed by IT teams, staff and other users. Consequently, questions of trust and habit are important too, beyond the added or absent features it brings.
