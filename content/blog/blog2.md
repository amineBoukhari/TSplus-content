**Fast yet intertwined, such is our world today. Internet plays perhaps the greatest part in both these aspects, and, when well harnessed, it can also be one of the most potent to slow everything down.**


Indeed, remote access software stands increasingly as a fundamental pillar the digital landscape and enables individuals and organizations to transcend the limitations of physical proximity. It is the key to remote working, connecting to computers and networks from anywhere, regardless of distance, location, language, via an internet connection.


Of all technology, remote access software therefore needs to be carefully chosen, according to a variety of criteria. With that goal in mind, let us discuss some of the best remote access software and weigh up their principal advantages and disadvantages.


## Why Remote Access Software?


Whether you are a tech support specialist, an IT professional, an IT administrator in an SMB or enterprise, or a remote worker, the power of remote access software is undeniable. It allows you to remotely access applications, files and systems, and to remotely control them, all as though you were physically present. It gives legacy software a new lease of life and grants thin-client and light devices the power and speed of your top of the range servers to run heavy applications. No wonder it a vital tool for streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.


## Understanding Remote Access Software


Remote access software, also referred to as remote control or remote desktop software, empowers you to view and take command of a computer or the apps or data it contains, from a distant location. Here, the focus is away from support or troubleshooting and on application publishing and web-enabling. This is not only about viewing screens; it is about full control, where you can operate the mouse and keyboard, effectively using the computer as if it were right in front of you, harnessing its live memory and processing power as well as its contents, from wherever you may be, on whichever device.


The protocols behind this technology, such as RDS/RDP for Windows, Chromoting for Chrome Remote Desktop, VNC/RFB for VNC, etc., ensure seamless communication between devices. These protocols might have different names and origins, but they all serve the same core function: bridging the gap between your location and the remote system. Some products focus on one protocol alone, others provide wider compatibility and let you choose.


**But, we will need some criteria to sift through the large number of software products available on the market. For today, let us leave aside remote control. Our focus is going to be remote access for [distant desktops, application publishing and accounts management](https://tsplus.net/remote-access/).**


## Criteria - 1: The Safety and Security of Remote Access Software


The current digital landscape is recurringly marked by ever-growing cyber threats. Thus, security is paramount when considering remote access software. Ensuring the safety of your data, privacy and network is critical. To my mind, the most reputable remote access software providers prioritize security as a core feature of their offerings. They employ robust encryption protocols, such as single sign-on authentication (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device authentication, to fortify their defenses against potential breaches. Furthermore, they maintain comprehensive logs and session recordings, ensuring necessary auditability and compliance with data protection regulations. By adopting remote access solutions that are designed with security in mind, you can confidently navigate and harness the digital realm, bridging physical distances with trust and reliability.


## Criteria - 2: Compatibility of Any Remote Access Software with Your IT Infrastructure


Another key factor to consider is the compatibility of the software with your operating systems and devices. It can be beneficial to make use of free trial periods to test and assess their suitability before choosing a paid solution.


## Criteria - 3: Matters of Performance and Efficiency


Additionally, evaluating the speed and performance of the software will most likely be central. Indeed, however they may use it, our colleagues and customers all need efficiency and stability from your company’s remote access. That means ensuring a seamless user experience wherever possible.


## Criteria - 4: Best Remote Access Software - Ease of Installation and Use


Rare are the companies and lives in which time is not of the essence for all involved. Thus, ease of setup of the software is essential. The lighter the load of training to use new software and tools, be it financially or for staff involvement, the better the transition. Intuitive and simple will often have a clear advantage over long and complicated for all those involved.


## Criteria - 5: Affordable and Good Value-for-Money Remote Access Products


You may have noticed different providers market their products using different pricing structures. Around the actual price, and whether it is on subscription, for a lifetime or another plan, it is clear that the quality of the web-shop, publicity and communication will play in selling a product, as will the visibility, popularity and more.


There are advantages and disadvantages in both a lifetime license and a subscription. No wonder: choosing between a long-term investment and small recurring payments is one of those questions everyone among us will probably address relatively regularly throughout life. Much of the answer depends on our intent, our current financial situation and what we know we can count on in the near future.


## Criteria - 6: Essential Features of Top Remote Access Software


Picking out which features are essential, as in your company can in no way do without them, could be the biggest hurdle. All the more since available features are likely to depend on price, due to the fact great features can be used as buying levers. Nonetheless, remember two things. Firstly, there are many products out there, many. And, secondly, there are software developers intent more on seeing their great products out, in use and benefitting lives than on only bringing in dividends. Therefore, if you take the time to carefully list your top “can’t do without” features, chances are you could find the perfect fit after all.


## Time to get started:


So, remote access software tools each have their strengths and may be suitable for different use cases. You can evaluate them based on your company's specific requirements, such as remote access speed, security, ease and feature set and also price. It should also be beneficial to try out more than one of these tools to see which aligns best with your needs. If you have any specific questions or need more detailed information on any of these tools, please feel free to ask.
