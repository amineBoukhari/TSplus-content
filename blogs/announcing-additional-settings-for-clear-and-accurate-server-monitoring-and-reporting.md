**A month ago, TSplus released a modernized version of Server Genius, renamed Server Monitoring; a comprehensive monitoring and reporting tool for RDS infrastructures. Since then, customer feedback has already enabled the developer to bring a number of new features and improvements for clear and accurate data collection.**
[**TSplus Server Monitoring**](https://tsplus-servermonitoring.com/)**v5 was designed for On-site and Cloud-Hosted IT infrastructures. It provides real-time information about the health of Remote Desktop, Web portal and Application servers.**

Server Monitoring in its newest version has met success from the start, thanks to two assets:  
* It is quick and easy to install ([see online documentation](https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/server-monitoring/installation)), with very little configuration and a handy Administration tool to centralize all data and settings
* It is very powerful as it enables monitoring of a complete farm of servers with thousands of users and different websites from one single place, gathering useful data and providing ready-to-use reports about the network health.


With access to vital information,**IT and Network administrators can also build their own detailed reports.** The customization tool provides many options to enable the creation of professional looking corporate documents with selected data compiled in easy-to-read tables and graphs.  

To do so, Admins have access to the following metrics:  
* User load and application use on Remote Access application servers.
* Traffic numbers and patterns on websites and web portals.


## Server Monitoring Constantly Enhanced To be More Accurate


**Based on customer feedback, new settings have been added to make server monitoring and reporting even more precise and adapted to each need.**

Admins now have the ability to blacklist processes that they do not want to monitor, and to see the database size as part of the reporting. There is a new option to add labels on alerts that distinguish websites alerts from server alerts.  

Overall, developers at TSplus are bringing weekly improvements to keep user satisfaction high with a highly adjustable reporting tool - language updates and settings localization, additional reports data, new customization options...  

The online documentation is frequently updated as well to reflect these changes and evolves with every new customer inquiry.
