## TSplus Has All the Ingredients to be a Leader in Remote Access.


This quarter, TSplus was rewarded more than once for its performance, its high customer satisfaction, and its ambitious innovation mindset. Starting with SourceForge, the world's largest software comparison directory featuring user reviews, product comparisons, software guides, and more. **The platform recognized TSplus in October as a**[**Top Performer Remote Desktop software**](https://tsplus.net/remote-access-keeps-its-position-as-sourceforge-top-performer-software-in-remote-desktop-category/)**, before upgrading the company to the status of Leader in this category.**

It has been a long business relationship between my company and TSPlus and over time I have built good working relationships with them. A key factor for me is that the staff I am dealing with now are the same ones I started with over 10 years ago which is comforting and to me indicates a stable company that will be around as long as I am.”
