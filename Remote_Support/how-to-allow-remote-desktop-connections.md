Remote desktop connections are a valuable tool for IT professionals and businesses. They allow secure access to computers and servers from remote locations. This can serve companies in a whole range of situations, including what we have as today’s focus: remote support and screen control tasks.

Before remote access recently became a basic necessity, one of the initial reasons using RDP became common was for screen control and remote support. First, here's a step-by-step guide on how to allow remote desktop connection. Once you have enabled this feature native to Windows-based systems, next, you can choose to leverage [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/) so that those remote connections can be the lifeline of the host computers you will access.
## Allowing Remote Desktop Connections


### Step 1: Ensure Remote Desktop is Enabled:


1. **Open System Properties**: Right-click "This PC" (or "My Computer" in older Windows versions). Then, select "Properties."
2. **Access Remote Settings**: In the System window, in the left-hand menu, click on "Remote settings". You need administrative privileges for this step.
3. **Enable Remote Desktop**: In the Remote tab of the System Properties window, check the box labelled "Allow remote connections to this computer."


**NB**: You may select the option to allow connections from any version of Remote Desktop, or you can choose to allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (more secure).


### Step 2: Configure Firewall and Network Settings


1. **Adjust Firewall Settings**: Make sure your firewall isn't blocking Remote Desktop. You may need to add an exception for "Remote Desktop" or "mstsc.exe" (the Remote Desktop client).
2. **Check Network Connectivity**


: Ensure that your computer is connected to the network or the internet, as remote connections require a network connection.


### Step 3: Grant User Access


1. **Select Users**: To allow specific users to connect remotely, click the "Select Users" button in the Remote tab.
2. **Add Users**: In the Remote Desktop Users window, click "Add" and enter the names of the users who should have remote access. Click "OK" when finished.


### Step 4: Connect Remotely to Remote Desktops


1. **Find Your Computer's IP Address**: You'll need your computer's IP address to connect remotely. One way you can find it is by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu, opening Command Prompt and typing "ipconfig".
2. **Remote Desktop Connection**: On the remote computer, open the Remote Desktop client (usually "mstsc.exe").
3. **Enter IP Address**: In the Remote Desktop client, enter the IP address or hostname of the computer to which you want to connect.
4. **Login**: You'll be prompted to enter the username and password of the remote computer. Once entered, click "Connect".
5. **Enjoy Remote Access**: You should now be connected to the remote computer's desktop.


### Step 5: Now You have Allowed Remote Desktop Connection, Secure Your Connection


1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that both the local and remote computers have strong, unique passwords.
2. **Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)**: If possible, enable NLA for an extra layer of security.
3. **Remember to follow best practice** for security, such as keeping your operating system and software updated. You can also consider using other security measures if necessary, such as a VPN, or, even better, TSplus Advanced Security.


## How to Use TSplus Remote Support to Allow Remote Desktop Connections


Following these steps will allow remote desktop connections to your Windows computer or server, enabling efficient IT management and support, just as [TSplus offers a simplified and secure alternative for remote access and control](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/).


TSplus Remote Support is a robust cloud-based software designed to provide attended and unattended remote assistance to clients. Here's a concise guide on how to make the most of this powerful tool.


### **Step 1**: Access TSplus Remote Support, With or Without an Account!


1. **Choose:** The first thing to do is to choose between expert or lite download. Are you an agent? Expert. Are you a general user requiring support? Lite.
2. **Download:** Download and install our software. From our website, this is done in a few clicks. The download should be rapid too since TSplus Remote Support is relatively light.
3. **Login:** If you don't want an account yet, it is possible to provide support without. Still, should you want to organise your computers, track session times and customise the console your clients will download, then sign up on the TSplus website. As an agent with an account, log in to TSplus Remote Support using your credentials.


**Dashboard:** Once all set, you will be greeted by our user-friendly administration console, which is the central hub for all your remote support activities.


### **Step 2**: Initiating Remote Assistance: Host or Agent Invites


1. **Invite the Agent:** As a host, you can invite an agent to assist your device remotely in one click on your console. They will then need your ID and the onetime password that appears on your screen.
2. **Launch a Support Session for a Saved Computer:** To assist a remote client, agents can also initiate a support session. You can do this from the TSplus Remote Support dashboard, in the tab entitled “computers”. [To save devices, remember you need to register and log in](https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/admin-console).


As you can see, for agents and hosts alike, TSplus provides easy ways to invite the other party to invite others and to launch or to join a session.
