## Simplify Commands with TSplus Remote Support


Remote Desktop is an invaluable tool for accessing and managing computers remotely. One action that remote desktop use will entail is being able to send command lines. For instance, many agents need to send the Ctrl+Alt+Del command to a remote desktop. Indeed, this specific keystroke combination typically triggers the local machine's security options.

In this article, we will explore various methods for how to send Ctrl+Alt+Del to remote desktop sessions. With this in mind, we will also see how [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/) is a simple and reliable solution to seamlessly send commands and for all your remote management.
## Understanding the Ctrl+Alt+Del Challenge


On Windows systems, Ctrl+Alt+Del is a key combination that is critical for security purposes. When pressed together on the local machine, these three keys open the Security Options screen. This menu in turn allows users to lock their computer, switch users or access the Task Manager. However, when working with a remote desktop session, sending Ctrl+Alt+Del can pose a challenge due to the interaction between the local and remote machines. It quite simply opens the menu options or Task Manager of the local machine. Yet, here, our aim is to access the remote menu or Task Manager.


## Method 1 – Ctrl+Alt+End on an On-Screen Keyboard:


The on-screen keyboard approach, a popular method, is to use the On-Screen Keyboard of the remote device. Of course you have to previously enable remote connections and create a remote user.


Once you have opened the remote session, the utility for this method can be accessed by following these steps:


1. Open the Start menu of the remote session and navigate to the "Accessories" folder.
2. Click on "Ease of Access" and select "On-Screen Keyboard." (You may also like to search for OSK in the menu-bar. This should yield the same result.)
3. Once the On-Screen Keyboard appears, click the Ctrl, Alt, and Del keys in sequence to send the command to the remote desktop session.


NB: If you have trouble opening the start menu due to mouse interference, command Alt+Home should open it anyhow.


## Method 2 – Ctrl+Alt+End on a Hardware Keyboard:


The Ctrl+Alt+End shortcut is another method. It consists in using the Ctrl+Alt+End key- combination instead. This emulates the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command within a remote desktop session.


Note there is another possibility within this method if you have a part-size keyboard or small laptop (There, End is not on the right-hand 1 key since the number-pad is absent. It is often by the arrows in that case.). It is to use the Fn key in combination with Del. This two-key pair generally still sends the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command to remote Terminal Servers.
Follow these steps once you have set- up a remote connection and that the remote session is active:


1. Ensure your active window is the open remote device session (for example by clicking on the remote desktop screen).
2. Press Ctrl+Alt+End simultaneously to send the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command to the remote session.


## Method 3:
