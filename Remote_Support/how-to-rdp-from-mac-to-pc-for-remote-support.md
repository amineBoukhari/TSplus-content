The IT sector is in constant growth and more than ever opens a myriad possibilities. With such potential at so many people’s finger-tips, it is no wonder that support is such a central necessity for any business, organisation or even household. The number of actions now feasible via a computer device and over the Internet is quite simply incredible. No wonder so many have trouble keeping pace.For a while now, the development team have been working on opening a new horizon for the Remote Support customers among you. They focused on a TSplus solution to "how to RDP from Mac to PC for remote support". Indeed, many companies use Windows day-in, day-out. Yet even amongst users who are essentially Microsoft-based, your companies generally have at least one, and sometimes more, Mac devices for specific teams or a variety of specialized uses.Up until now, these machines were outside of our support software’s reach. And once they got their heads together, well, forget RDP, and simply provide remote control and support from Mac to PC using [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/).
## Brainstorming, Developing and Growing the TSplus Way


The TSplus teams work closely together to make our products and solutions as simple, useful, affordable and, most importantly, secure. Regional managers, resellers and customers themselves provide valuable insight into customer and user needs and requirements, whether they specialize in sales or the support.


This user-centric approach allows our team of developers to craft features that align perfectly with the unique requirements of our clients. This improves our products in the most interesting directions possible, furnishing our clients with more pertinent solutions.


## Developing the Brand New Mac OS Compatibility for TSplus Remote Support


We have known for a while that potential TSplus users stuck with more expensive alternatives or kept on using them in parallel of our software, biding their time for this pending bridge between OSs. This seemed a pity, so a great deal of team hours has gone into this new string to our bow. There is no longer any need to be hampered in the breadth of your cross-platform interventions: you can download the most recent version of TSplus Remote Support now and [get the Mac client directly from our online quick-start guide](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/installation/#basics).


We aim for our users to be enabled to provide a more complete service thanks to this new capacity of the product. Indeed, the Mac capability works in both directions and from Mac to Mac. What a way to unleash Windows support provision from a Mac device and vice-versa while also opening new horizons.


#### Mac to Windows, Windows to Mac, Mac to Mac, and So On - No Extra Fee

## Set Up and Enable RDP Between a Mac and a Windows PC


### Connecting to Windows PCs from a Mac with RDP:


#### 1. Enable Remote Connections on your Windows PC:



* Open the System Properties on your Windows PC.
* Click on the "Remote" tab.
* Ensure that the "Allow remote connections to this computer" option is enabled.
* Ensure you have the appropriate cyber-security protection since RDP is otherwise vulnerable when facing the Web.


#### 2. Install and Configure Microsoft Remote Desktop Client on your Mac device:


* Visit the App Store on your Mac.
* Search for and install the "Microsoft Remote Desktop" client.
* Launch the Remote Desktop client on your Mac.
* Create a user profile, which is ready for use.


#### 3. Configure the Connection:


* Next to "Connection name," provide a “friendly name” (or nickname) for the connection.
* For "PC name," enter either the name you've given to your target PC or its IP address.
* No need to configure a gateway if you're connecting to your PC within the local network.
* You can add your user-name and password to the "Credentials" if you want to avoid entering them each time you connect.


### Connecting to Mac from Windows:


1. To connect from a Windows PC to a Mac, first you need a Mac connection client, which can be downloaded from the App Store.
2. It is worth noting that Mac systems use VNC for their remote desktop connections. Therefore, the main recommendation is to also use a VNC client on your PC.


This client could be why so many of our competitors provide Mac compatibility as extra, only in higher packages, etc.. So, do read on and find out how TSplus Remote Support can simplify your IT support as well as lighten your IT budget.


## A Word on Mac to PC and cost of subscription


Indeed, the Mac capability is available from TeamViewer and certain other providers, but often for an extra fee. Many also only include it in more complete and expensive packages. You may consider TeamViewer an option, or any other provider (these also may involve a subscription). Otherwise, TSplus Remote Support simply includes its [Mac to and from PC intervention feature](https://tsplus.net/pricing/remote-support/) in all its packages. Moreover, the TSplus Mac client is all you need for all these connections, even Mac to Mac. We think this is great value for money.


## Important Security Reminder for RDP


Are you trying to connect to the Windows PC from outside of your local network? If so, setting up a port forwarding or port redirection rule of ports 3389, 80, 443 is important. Which depends on your preferred connection method. You can modify RDP ports in the Home tab.


## Set up Remote Control between Mac and PC with TSplus Remote Support, no RDP?


With TSplus Remote Support, there is no more need for RDP and little or nothing to set up, even with mac. Indeed, the connection clients, as executables or DMGs, will enable you either to take control of a Remote Support session as an "agent" or to share sessions as an end-user.


#### 1. Download the TSplus Remote Support client:


* On your PC, download the TSplus Remote Support agent or end-user EXE file.
* On your Mac, download and run the Remote Support DMG. Like our Windows client, our Mac client is available directly from our website so you need not search any further for it.


#### 2. Launch our Mac client on your device:


* Double click the headset icon to launch our connection client.


#### 3. Validate the connection on your PC or Mac:


* Register if this is your first time, or simply log in.
* Accept the connection with the credentials the end-user shares with you or request to share your screen.


#### 4. Get to work!


* Now, your Mac and Windows PC are connected all that is left is to do your job. With everything set up correctly, you should now be able to control either device from either OS with TSplus fluidity, rapidity and security.
