Do you know how to black screen in TeamViewer? It is quite straightforward. You probably have the use for this feature. If it has clear uses, there are also alternatives. So, what is in store below? First some of the main reasons and uses for the black screen when remotely controlling another computer. Then the steps to follow to activate and de-activate a black screen. And to finish, a whistle-stop tour of our own TeamViewer alternative software [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/).
## What is a Black Screen in Remote Control?


A black screen is used to replace any display on a computer device while an agent works. When remotely controlling a screen, there may be a need for privacy, whether data or action related. The black screen serves this purpose in TSplus Remote Support and TeamViewer alike. It acts similarly to a locked sleep screen, since input is generally disabled. Black screen is basically a maintenance screen.


## Why a Black Screen? – Beyond a Screen Saver


More than a sleep screen or a screen-saver, a remote support black screen is a security tool. You can activate black screen during all or part of an intervention. It may be the client or the agent who sees the need for it. Then again, it may also be that the device is unattended.


Finally, it can work as a means to lessen the exchange of data when connections are slow. Indeed, no display means less information to send back and forth. In any case, any haphazard interference should be avoided during an agent’s work and private data be protected from prying eyes.


Additionally, for example, take an IT intervention done remotely and with no-one attending the remote device. Why use extra energy displaying everything to passers-by? The aim of the black screen remains primarily an uninterrupted work-flow, [privacy and data security](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/#security-hosting). Still, it has the added advantage of saving a little on the electricity bill.


## How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - Different Paths to Take


In TeamViewer, you have the option of going to black screen on the moment. Additionally, there are ways of setting the feature up for any connection to a given device. The spontaneous use of a black screen may be so the user of the remote PC can go on their break while the agent works on. On a long intervention, agent and client may agree on a time to return out of black screen. A recurrent setting would be appropriate for unattended maintenance and out of user hours work.


These would be situations which would free them from initiating individual sessions. What’s more, there is the option to customise the black screen. Imagine, for example, informing onlookers of maintenance or displaying company branding.


## How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - On the Spur of the Moment



For instantaneous black screen during a TeamViewer session, go to the “Actions” menu and scroll down to “show black screen”. You can set a permanent option for a specific user’s sessions to occur in black screen. This is function is found in the “Extras” menu of the user’s device. Under “Advanced”, modify the “Advanced Connection settings”. Generally, start by ticking “Disable local input”. Then tick “Enable local blackscreen”.


## How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - In Advance


A second path to do this exists in the agent’s console within the properties of each device. In the “Properties” window for any computer, the “Remote input” menu will open and offer three choices. It is possible to enable or disable remote input or to “Disable remote input and show black screen”.


## How to Undo Black Screen in TeamViewer


At any point, the use of Ctrl+Alt+Del or of Cmd+Option+Esc will remove the black screen, enable local input and lock the remote user session. For maintenance to continue, the local user will have to re-enable the agent session so they can input once more.


## TSplus Remote Support for Simple, Secure and Rapid Alternative to TeamViewer - for a Fraction of the Cost


TSplus has developed simple secure remote control and support software, setting itself as [TeamViewer alternative](https://tsplus.net/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support/). Remote Support has been designed to be adaptable for best performance. This is attainable whether over state-of-the-art Internet connections or via poor network, low bandwidth and slow Wi-Fi alike. Indeed, the display quality can be modulated to this purpose, thus lightening the data load.


As mentioned, it happens that one use for black screen is to cut down on data flow. By going to black screen the extra data created by the display is neither generated nor sent. We've worked at cutting out that need, choosing adaptability of the display quality instead.


## Replacing Black Screen with TSplus Remote Support


Remote Support has a simple set of features which we saw as essential for remote support and screen control. It can of course be used for fixing, troubleshooting and keeping systems up to date. It's great for training and demonstration purposes too. Where black screen is concerned, Remote Control has the [disable input feature](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/). It can be activated and de-activated from both ends.


So, we have done without the added black screen feature simply because most keyboards already have a button to this effect. Just the same as there is one to disable the touch-pad. As for PCs, regardless of what secrets their keyboards hold, most monitors have an on-off button. It therefore seemed that an specific feature was unnecessary here.


## TSplus Remote Support Features - Affordability, Efficiency, Simplicity


Taking close to nothing to do to get started, connection to Remote Support is ultra-quick. You can even host the download on your site for your clients. The handling of TSplus Remote Control is straight-forwards as well. Plus, to add to that, agents can present clients with the lite mode instead of the regular connection window. With only basic connection information this is ideal for its simplicity.


Working features start with screen sharing and keyboard and mouse control and include chat and files sharing. Clipboard synchronisation can be enabled or disabled, making copy and paste possible between devices. Multiple agents can attend sessions and there is the option to view any or all of the client monitors. Last but not the least, attended and unattended access and fully encrypted connections were paramount for us.


Many visual aspects of the consoles can be branded and customised. To start with, you can chose your language for the interface. Then you can add your logos and company colours according to your needs.
