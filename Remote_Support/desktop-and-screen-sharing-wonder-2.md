**Studies show that large numbers of people have computers and other IT devices in their homes. More and more workers are also working from home or on the road.** Through the height of the pandemic, remote access and web conferencing software enabled work and professional collaboration among co-workers and clients in spite of all the lock-downs. Now companies and workers make more frequent use than ever of the potential of software such as **[TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/)** for enabling teamwork regardless of geographical distance.
## Remote Access Software! A Whole Range of Potential

Some types of remote software can be used downloaded or simply accessed via a URL, using a password or access code to connect. All these ways of remotely accessing workstations and applications lessen the company outlay on travel as well as the time and effort invested on travelling.


## From RDP to Remote Assistance


Thanks to Remote Desktop Protocol, accessing a device remotely and controlling it to update or fix it can be done in real time over the Internet. Desktop sharing is one of the most important feature for remote support. It enhances the ability to solve issues, show steps to follow and generally troubleshoot without needing to visit the colleague or customer. A remote support team can be dotted around the globe and still do its job to a T. They may indeed be able to carry out better interventions due to a wider availability around the clock. Indeed, members from the other side of the planet can be reactive and give assistance while it is night-time locally due to the time difference.

It becomes easy to provide assistance at any time, from any place. The data shared amounts to images rather than the actual applications or data on which the agent is working. That way, company data remains safe behind the company firewall, while end-to-end encryption makes sure that what does travel goes safely wherever it travels.

All of this takes place via one brief exchange of credentials.


The host computer can also hand over the control of the mouse and keyboard to the remote user. Handing off the control will enable the remote user to manipulate the mouse and keyboard of the host computer.


## Remote Assistance and Support Over Any Bandwidth


According to the bandwidth of their connection, users can choose higher or lower resolution for the screen share. This feature permits less detailed video streaming data to be sent over lower bandwidth connection. Agents still efficiently carry out the job without being hampered by the fact that not all Internet connections are strong, fast and ideal. And where the connection is at its best, all users can enjoy high-definition visuals and rapid, reactive responses of their devices.


## User-Friendly Remote Support and Assistance
