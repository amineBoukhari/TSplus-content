## TeamViewer Accounts Management for Businesses


Businesses using TeamViewer may encounter the need to delete accounts belonging to former staff members from their company's TeamViewer. However, based on several posts on the TeamViewer community forum, the platform's account deletion process falls short in providing a bulk solution to this task.


Are you interested in a simple and affordable yet secure and powerful solution to use instead of TeamViewer? Then our own [TSplus Remote Support](https://tsplus.net/remote-support/) software could be just what you have been looking for.

## Agents, Groups and Data Management With TSplus Remote Support


By default, sessions are not shared, but an agent can invite one or more others, on a case by case basis, great for team work and more. Our software being self-hosted in dedicated servers, connexions are rapid and interventions fluid. Then, as all logs are locally held, TSplus has access to no client data whatsoever. Finally, beyond the Agent Accounts tab, the administrator also has direct access to licence related aspects directly within the TSplus licencing portal.


## General Account Management and Related Issues in Company Accounts


In any accounts management scenario, not being unable to completely remove deleted users is likely to lead to those users remaining assigned to closed and expired cases in a company’s service queue. This inability to unassign users presents a potential challenge when the account owner is no longer accessible, as in the case of old staff members.


As a consequence, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance questions will arise since, so long as the individual does not delete the account themselves, the company will be left with this open-ended situation.


## Planning for Appropriate Data and Accounts Management


This leaves a joint responsibility with businesses and employees: to collaborate in going through all the steps required to preserve personal and company data and accesses from being left available to potential issues such as cyber-attacks. And with any company lies the responsibility of closely examining available options when choosing software, services and any other suppliers or products.


It is worth finding out in advance how data and account information will be processed, held, deleted, etc. It may sway your decisions towards one or another solution.
