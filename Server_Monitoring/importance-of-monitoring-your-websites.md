## Are you monitoring your websites?


**It is very important to monitor any website you may run. This is especially true if you are using them to make some extra cash, and definitely if a website is your only source of income. [TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) is a tool you can use to help protect your websites from so many nasties which could affect your bottom line. Whether you want to generate visibility or income, website surveillance can make all the difference. Any of the following could bring a website to a close.**
## Monitoring your websites Against Hack Attacks


If your website is hacked, it could be used for any number of illegal activities.


A hacker could use your hosting account to send UCE (Spam) from your domain or even add web pages such as user information "phishing" sites. These sites will have a page which looks like a login page for Paypal, eBay or any bank. If someone fills in the form, their details are sent to the hacker who then has access to their account. In this event, your website will be shut down. You risk losing money while you sort out the mess.


## Monitoring your Websites Against Non-Authorised Activity


If you have any user information stored on your websites server, a hacker may also gain access to that. Personal information is a very easy commodity to sell on and something that can do deep damage to individuals and businesses on a several levels.


It is important to keep an eye on your site for any unexpected activity or for unusual stats showing concerning pages you didn't make yourself. Most accounts have some kind of statistics built into the control panel so it shouldn't cost too much to monitor visits and hits and see to which pages they go.


## Monitor and Update your Websites


Also, make sure any scripts you use are secure and updated with any patches to keep the hackers out.


**With [Tsplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/), you can keep an eye on the up-time and down-time of your servers and websites.** You can monitor percentages of usage and see how each is doing individually. This way, you can keep track of which needs closer attention or when traffic is fine.


## Monitoring Your Websites Against Hosting or Server Problems


Your host or server may have a problem, such as loss of access to the internet, or crashing. Theses sort of problems can take down with them all sites hosted there.


This gives you two potential headaches, firstly loss of business while everything is offline, and secondly but more importantly potential loss of data. Making sure you take regular backups of all your databases and all your sites’ pages will help.


## Monitoring Your Websites Against Hosting Problems


In addition, monitoring how often any outages occur as well as how long each lasts will tell you whether it's time to change hosts. No host can guarantee with absolute certainty 100% uptime, but some are much more prone to downtime than others.


If you have all the site information backed up, moving hosts isn't as much of a task as it used to be, so it can be done in quite a short time if needed.As hosting is such a cut-throat business, finding a new one is also relatively simple.


## Monitoring Your Websites and Servers with TSplus


There are even software programs which will alert you if your site is unavailable. **[TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/)** is one of these. You will receive alerts from the software while you run it and you can set notifications of various kinds which you or other specific people will receive. This is a great way to nip problems in the bud. You will often fix any trouble before clients even realise there was one.


## A Bit About Blog and Forum Spamming


With the all-pervasive spread of blogging, it was inevitable that some people would resort to spamming blog platforms. Forums and message boards are also open to abuse from software which will auto-post to thousands of sites in minutes.


This field is not covered by TSplus software but is well worth knowing about if your business involves websites where commenting is possible.


## The Problems With Blog Spamming


If your blog is able to accept comments, it is wise to ask for some kind of registration from people who wish to make comments. You should also be able to check comments before letting them be published. If you don't ask for registration or vet comment-posting, you leave your blog open to blatant advertising done by software. These will be unlikely to bear any relevance to your blogs subject, will discredit your blog pages and are likely to turn away people who would have been interested.


## The Problems With Forum Spamming


This goes for your forums too. Allowing guests to post without registration is open to abuse by widely available software which auto-posts inane comments with a signature containing a URL to the spammers product. Even with registration activated you may find some users often known as “trolls” who register only to post negative, abusive or divisive comments and other irrelevant and inane messages.


## Benefits of User Registration for Websites


Registration is a good solution, especially if you don’t have time to actually all comments to monitor and validate or refuse them. Asking for registration will help ensure that only people committed to posting something relevant get to add their comments or posts. If someone truly wants to post, they will take the time to register.


## Monitoring your websites


It may take a little time but monitoring your websites could save you from a lot more wasted time in the future.


Backups of your site will help and should be taken at least weekly. And all your scripts should at least have security updates as soon as they are released.
