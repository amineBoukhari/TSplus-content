## What is a Server?


**A server is a piece of equipment that allows you to run an application on a computer. What you are able to do depends on the type of server you are connected to.** In fact, any computer can be designated as a server. A server is usually optimized for the user’s needs and provides access to multiple users at any one time.
The number of users will depend on the size and processing power of the server. **Servers are used to offer remote access, database access and more generally to transfer files over a secure network.**
## Application Servers


Application Servers are computers that host applications for use and access from other computers. Generally designed to allow connections from multiple users simultaneously, app servers are often a benefit to businesses because it is more secure, cost effective and practical to have mission-critical applications installed in one place, than having them installed on multiple machines. This becomes especially important in a mobile workforce where business data is accessed by a wide array of devices that may not be directly under control of the business.


## Server Farms


Server and server farms vary in size depending on the processing power needed and the amount of workload they are expected to handle during operational time. For example, a batch of server applications may be divided between a number of separate server computers in exceptional circumstances. However, in most cases, the server application can run on a single computer if the workload is light enough. With several applications, great numbers of users, or both, multiple servers are soon necessary. A group of servers working as one lot are called a farm of servers.


## Cyber-security, Servers and Risks


Most network designers will carry out a risk assessment of the servers and the information held on them, in order to limit damage that a server crash would cause. In order to do this, they would split up one server computer to handle one specific server application


It is also possible to use a server computer as a workstation computer. But, this may not be a company’s first choice due to the risks and damage that could be associated with this dual use, either on the grounds of security reasons and information safety purposes. Indeed, most servers tend to be shielded from the Internet while PCs are less far removed from the front line that is the Web.


## Internet as an Illustration of What a Server Farm is!


One of the best examples of how a farm of servers can work together is the Internet. The Internet is comprised of the client to server model where the Internet Service Providers direct the traffic across the biggest group of networked computers in the world. When thinking about servers and their role in daily life, it is useful to picture the Internet as it provides a clear picture of their use and function.


## Need to Monitor Your Servers


Now, if you are running more than one server, whether they form a network or not, you’ll need to monitor them somehow to overlook a whole panel of aspects of their usage and health. There is software available designed to perform that very task.


## What Server Monitoring Software is and does!


Server monitoring software enables IT technicians and administrators to perform a whole array of surveillance tasks. From controlling and monitoring the network traffic from a local area network and the internet, to seeing how much usage each server undergoes at any point in time, whether in terms of actual users or of overall workload, they can follow performances and use of individual servers and whole farms.


## How to Monitor Your Corporate Servers and Networks


TSplus has developed its own software, [TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/), with the these needs and more in mind. Network and server monitoring software is a diagnostic tool that monitors server and websites and displays network statistics in graphics or tables.

## Server Monitoring Features


The basics are there, such as CPU and memory usage, disk read and write percentage statistics for each of your servers. You can follow in real time usage of each application, the bandwidth and users of each server. For websites you may track general site availability and look more specifically at response time at different point as well as having the visibility over average, minimum and maximum response times.


## Monitor Your Servers at Any Time and from Any Place


A very important feature of our software is that you can tailor and get alerts. Beyond the comprehensive tables of alerts available in the Alerts tab of the TSplus Server Monitoring Dashboard, you can choose to receive email or Teams notifications whenever there is an alert, thus speeding up considerably response times when you are not in front of your screen.


They will inform you when certain thresholds or criteria are reached. You can decide to be notified should any server memory fill to 90% or if they run on too great a percentage of their RAM capacity, or you could set different thresholds per server. You can receive emails for server downtime as well as concerning any website.


## Generate Reports


You can generate reports for your servers and websites, choose aspects according to your audience or needs and visually tailor them to your company colours. It is also possible for these reports to be automatically emailed according to filters you can create and amend.
