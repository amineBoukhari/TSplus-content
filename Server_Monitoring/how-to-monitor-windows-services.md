Command lines, Powershell, scripting… If you need to know how to monitor Windows services, all those could mark the path to follow. Yet, as time is scarce, though DIY should be ideal, it is not always the best adapted solution. A simple ready-made yet efficient software tool could be more welcome that a precise tutorial or a new set of skills. [TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) at the ready.
## What are Windows Services?


Windows services are generally executables, therefore applications or programs as we know them. The difference is the fact they can be launched directly by the OS as it boots up. They also often have special privileges. This is unlike standard applications which run at the user’s request.


Note that Windows services can serve to log events, access files or report errors, to provide access to web-resources or even for services like printing. Yet they can be installed as part of a third party application or driver. Anything from user management to parental control and autosaves, Windows services are useful for such programs as for instance a printer-scanner or a cyber-security suite. To illustrate, cache is a great example of a service: does DNS ring any bells? No DNS service, no cache.


Should you want to see those running on your device, one of the easiest paths is to search “services” in the Windows menu search bar. The window you will open will list Windows services. With admin rights you could also choose when to run a service, start-up or later, automatically or manually. Although, please bear in mind, you first need to know whether altering this status will interfere with proper running of anything crucial.


## What Does Monitoring Windows Services Entail?


Indeed, do you have the time to learn what scripts to write, how, where? Are you a technician with the skill and time to set everything up from there? Then, the best thing is to go ahead with it. But the time factor is a constraint that will not be ignored. That is true whether you know how to wield script, cmdlets and more or want to learn.


But! How long will it take you to confidently write lines knowing that your commands are not about to break your machine? If you know the theory, you still have to choose what to type and where to apply it. This depends, according to the services you want to monitor, on which servers, etc. Do you know how to set up alerts in command shell?


Now, let us say you have set alerts to be sent. You still need to act on them. Drawing conclusions to learn from the data is probably also incumbent to you. So next, you will have to gather all that data and process it. That way, you can draw conclusions and implement changes accordingly. Perhaps this is the biggest variable so far. How long will it take you to go through the data yielded by the monitoring processes you set? It takes time.


Once you’ve processed it (or input it for a software tool to do so), how will you compile then send it? Indeed, you are also likely to want to inform colleagues of data progression, trends, events, conclusions, and more.


## How to Monitor Windows Services - Questions for Planning


Another step when monitoring Windows (or other) services is to know what you plan to watch. Here are some points to clarify. On any given server, what processes are running? Which server and services do you want to monitor? Are you interested in them all or only ones? Who is due to receive the feedback generated here? Which person needs reports on which processes and services? Such planning is needed whether you use command prompts and Powershell or whether you choose a software tool instead.
