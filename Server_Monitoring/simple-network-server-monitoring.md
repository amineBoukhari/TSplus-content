Nowadays, business never stops. Network servers play a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of an incredible numbers of IT systems. All this is further beyond our parents’ wildest dreams than expected. Its aim is to maintain optimal performance and minimise downtime. Hence why it is essential to implement an effective server monitoring strategy.

This article provides a summary of network server monitoring, including an introduction to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). It goes on to explore the importance for businesses of simple networking server monitoring. I will highlight how our own [TSplus Server Monitoring can make the difference](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) in your surveillance and communication for the whole of your network.
## What is network server monitoring?


Network server monitoring is a critical practice for businesses to ensure the optimal performance, availability and security of their network servers. It refers to the practice of actively monitoring and managing network servers within an organization. The surveillance covers the performance, availability, and security of each server and often of the afferent website. It involves using specialised tools and techniques to collect and analyse data related to these.


Consequently, server health, resource usage, network connectivity and security incidents are not only watched. Information is also gathered on the status of each of these. Indeed, by drawing conclusions from the data collected in this process, companies can adjust their servers, networks, etc. to improve. By monitoring network servers, businesses can gain valuable insights into their infrastructure's overall health. Additionally, they can proactively detect and address issues and ensure the efficiency of critical systems and applications.


## What Does IT Administration Aim to Achieve with Good Monitoring?


The primary goal of network server monitoring is to maintain optimal server performance and minimise downtime. It enables administrators to track key performance indicators such as CPU utilisation, memory usage, disk space availability and network traffic. These metrics are generally monitored in real-time or on a scheduled basis.


This enables administrators to identify potential bottlenecks, predict resource requirements and take proactive measures to optimise server performance. Furthermore, network server monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the availability and reliability of server resources. A fluid network depends on this. Surveillance helps detect and alert administrators about service failures, hardware malfunctions or network connectivity issues. In turn, by receiving timely notifications, IT teams can quickly respond to these incidents.


Thus, good network monitoring paves the way to troubleshoot problems and minimise their impact on business operations. Analysis can even help plan for certain issues and adjust demands on the infrastructure accordingly. Here, the tool therefore enables prevention through forwards planning.


## Increased Security as an Added Perk to Monitoring Your Network


Another essential aspect of network server monitoring is boosted security. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats, monitoring server logs, network traffic and system behaviour is crucial. They indeed help detect any unauthorised access attempts, unusual activities or potential security breaches.


By analysing the collected data, administrators can identify security vulnerabilities, implement appropriate security measures and enhance the overall server security posture. All this contributes to maintain the stability and efficiency of your business’ IT infrastructure.


## A quick aside About Simple Network Management Protocol


Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted network management standard. It allows administrators to monitor and manage network devices, including servers. Therefore, it is most often a central process in today’s topic. SNMP operates on a client-server model. In such a model, SNMP agents are installed on managed devices, then a central SNMP manager collects and analyses data from these agents.


The structure used by the protocol to organise and represent data is called the Management Information Base (MIB). This contains data such as system performance metrics, network statistics and device configurations. By leveraging SNMP, administrators can proactively monitor server health, track performance metrics and receive notifications in case of any anomalies or critical events. [With TSplus, much of this is made simple.](https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/server-monitoring/) Read on for more detail.


## Areas of Network Server Monitoring:


Crucial to businesses, server monitoring ensures the availability, reliability and security of their network servers. Here are some key aspects of effective server monitoring:


1. **Performance Monitoring:** Server monitoring tools enable the tracking of vital performance metrics like CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk space, network traffic. By monitoring these metrics, administrators can identify bottlenecks, forecast resource requirements and optimise server performance.
2. **Fault Detection:** Real-time monitoring helps detect server faults, such as service failures, hardware issues and connectivity problems. Immediate notification and alerting mechanisms enable IT teams to quickly respond to critical events, reducing downtime. This, in turn, mitigates potential business impacts.
3. **Capacity Planning:** Server monitoring allows administrators to gather historical data on resource usage patterns, enabling effective capacity planning. Therefore, you can analyse trends and make a projection of future demands. This allows businesses to proactively allocate resources, scale infrastructure and avoid performance degradation due to capacity limitations.
4. **Security Monitoring:** Server monitoring tools can also assist in identifying security threats and vulnerabilities. Hence why monitoring log files, network traffic and system behaviour is paramount. Thus, administrators can detect suspicious activities, unauthorised access attempts or potential breaches, consequently enhancing overall server security.


## Simple and User-Friendly Network Monitoring with TSplus


For businesses seeking comprehensive server monitoring solutions, [TSplus offers an advanced monitoring platform designed for simplicity and ease-of-handling.](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) No less powerful and quite precise, TSplus Server Monitoring provides essential server and website surveillance features. Our goal is to ensure the optimal performance and security of your network.


## Key Features of TSplus Server Monitoring include:


1. **Real-time Monitoring:** TSplus Server Monitoring offers real-time visibility into critical server metrics. It provides administrators with up-to-date information on server and website health, performance and user activity. Servers can be Windows or Linux.
2. **Alerting and Notifications:** The platform proactively detects anomalies or critical events. According to your chosen settings, you can just watch the console for alerts or additionally set efficient alerts. Server Monitoring then sends instant alerts to administrators via email or SMS. This ensures prompt action and minimises downtime.
3. **Performance Analytics:** With TSplus Server Monitoring, generate detailed reports and analytics from the data collected by the surveillance. This enables IT administrators to track server performance over time and draw any other conclusions. It helps identify trends in performance and usage. It will also highlight potential bottlenecks and any needs for load-balancing. These are examples of potential resource optimisation opportunities. Finally, one of the main aims of such reports are communicating this information amongst teams and with management for various reasons.
4. **Security Auditing:** As a monitoring platform, TSplus Server Monitoring enables security auditing by capturing and analysing user sessions, logins, and access attempts. This way, our software helps detect suspicious activities and enhances server security.
