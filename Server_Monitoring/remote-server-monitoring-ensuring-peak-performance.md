In IT management, remote monitoring tools have become indispensable assets for IT departments and managed service providers (MSPs). This means understanding and optimising your server and website performance is crucial. Infrastructure monitoring can give both overall and precise view of your servers, applications and internet-facing services, their usage and more.

Thus, such software enables proactive maintenance, prevention and troubleshooting of networks and IT assets, all from a centralised location. In this article, delve with me into the significance of remote server monitoring, its key features and hence some criteria for selecting the right server monitoring software. We will finish with by looking at what our very own [TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) has to offer.
## Why Remote Server Monitoring Matters


As businesses expand, so do their resources, workforce and IT infrastructure. Therefore, the complexity of all these increases too, as well as their demands on each other and how they interact. With growth comes the need for a robust performance monitoring solution that can observe the health, activities and capability of servers.


Server monitoring tools offer solutions in this context. Indeed, they step in to address a host of challenges faced by IT administrators. These can involve events and incidents such as server crashes, slow applications, unexpected downtime and thus the need to troubleshoot various issues.


## Sought-After Features of Remote Monitoring Software


### 1. Remote Server Monitoring Software - Did I Hear “Remote”?


Effective monitoring software should encompass a range of features that empower IT teams and MSPs to manage their networks and IT assets efficiently. One “feature” I am going to take for granted in this article is that of remote access. Indeed, the ability to remotely monitor (and hence access) devices is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving issues without physical presence.


Remote is the main reason interventions can be instant and efficient. It could be because remote access and remote monitoring enable technicians and other teams to be available and respond without having to travel or in the middle of the night because they are on the other side of the planet. So, our topic focuses specifically on monitoring from anywhere.


### 2. Real-Time System Monitoring - Moment by Moment to Never Miss a Thing!


Server monitoring tools allow continuous monitoring of systems, keeping a vigilant eye on their performance and health. Tools with frequent regular visibility and logging are arguably the only way forwards.


To make real-time surveillance work, notifications and alerts prove essential. Being informed of an overload or downtime or that a threshold has been reached is crucial to reacting in a timely manner. For teams to take the appropriate action on time, it is necessary for them to be aware of the need to act and on what part of the system.


### 3. Resources Management:


Efficient infrastructure management seeks to balance, streamline and automate workload and data allocation. This is key in optimising memory usage and enabling efficiency, stability, speed and productivity.


### 4. Value for Money - One extra for the road:


Pricing should reflect the value and functionality offered by the tools, ensuring a cost-effective solution.


## Four Criteria for the Right Remote Server Monitoring Software


Selecting the ideal software to monitor your IT infrastructure is a critical decision for IT professionals in any organisation or trade. Like I said, the premise of this article is that it includes remote accessibility, so remote administrators can access endpoints. Beyond that, here are the key criteria to consider:


1. **Integrated Tools:** Look for a package that includes all necessary tools within a single interface, reducing the need to switch between tasks and windows.
2. **Scalability:** The software should accommodate your growth and provide support for multiple clients and networks.
3. **Trial Period:** Opt for software that offers a free trial or a money-back guarantee, allowing you to assess its suitability for your needs without financial risk.
4. **Security:** Prioritise software that emphasises security, as protecting sensitive data is paramount in today's digital landscape.
