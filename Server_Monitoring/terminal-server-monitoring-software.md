Until Windows 2008, what is now RDS was known as Terminal Services. Terminal servers of any kind most often function using such technology to provide networking and to communicate. Incidentally, for a network to run efficiently, any servers need to be used without overload or glitches. Terminal server monitoring software is the best way of watching out for this and surveying areas of potential concern.
## Wide Variety of Terminal Server Monitoring Software


There are many tools and products available to watch servers and networks. Whether free or paid and whether issue-specific or with a wider array of parameters in focus, the choice is broad. Indeed, some developers have chosen to monitor one specific aspect of a server or network, a set of actions within a set remit. Others have opted for a tool-kit approach, choosing a number of different items and watching each of them.


Generally, it seems that IT administrators often choose to mix-and-match, combining any number of more or less comprehensive tools. This enables them to tailor their tool-set to their needs.
