**As a system administrator, monitoring your corporate network servers is critical for ensuring the smooth operation of your organization's IT infrastructure. Fortunately, with the right tools and procedures in place, server monitoring for business can become a piece of cake.** With [TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/), you can stay on top of server performance and website responsiveness and prevent issues from turning into serious problems. In this guide, we'll discuss the steps you can take to monitor your corporate network servers effectively.
## Step 1: Choose the Right Server Monitoring Tool


The first step in monitoring your corporate network servers is selecting the right tool for the job. At TSplus, we offer an advanced Server Monitoring solution that enables you to track server performance in real-time and receive alerts when issues arise. With our tool, you can monitor server CPU usage, disk space, memory consumption and other critical metrics. This way, you can set up automatic remediation actions to keep your servers running smoothly.


## Step 2: Configure Server Monitoring for Your Business


Once you have chosen the right server monitoring tool, the next step is to configure it to meet your specific needs. With TSplus Server Monitoring, it is easy to add new servers or websites, to modify or remove them as needs evolve, and more.


You can for example customize monitoring thresholds, choose for which servers and configure alert notifications. Such tools mean you and your team will be made aware of any issues as they arise. By tailoring your monitoring settings to your organization's unique requirements, you also ensure that you are only alerted when critical events occur and minimize false alarms.


## Step 3: Monitor Server Performance


With your server monitoring tool configured, you are ready to begin monitoring your network servers in real-time. Check your monitoring dashboard regularly to ensure that servers and websites are operating within expected parameters and look for any warning signs that indicate potential issues. If you notice any anomalies, investigate them further to determine the root cause and take appropriate action.


## Step 4: Use Historical Data for Analysis


One goal of real-time monitoring is to gather regular precise historical data about the different parts of your network. Nevertheless, it is important to use that historical data for trend analysis and forecasting.


With TSplus Server Monitoring, you can access this data. From it, generate reports that help you identify patterns in server performance over time. Then, use these reports and results to optimize server resources, plan for future capacity needs and identify potential issues before they become critical.


## Step 5: Stay Up-to-Date with Server Monitoring Best Practice


As technology and security threats continue to evolve, something important is to stay up-to-date with server monitoring best practice. At TSplus, we regularly update our Server Monitoring tool with the latest features and security enhancements. This helps you, as customers, keep in step with technology. It also makes sure our software remains compatible in spite of any changes to the Windows environment and such related programs. So, our Updates and Support Service is a highly valuable add-on.


Additionally, we maintain a comprehensive user guide for each of our products. This works hand-in-hand with each Quick-start guide. Apart from these readily available online tools, you have access to our technical support to help you get the most out of your server monitoring solution.
