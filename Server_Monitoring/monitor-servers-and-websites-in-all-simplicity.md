Whatever your reason for having one or more servers or websites, you are likely to need to keep an eye on their performance to make sure they are accessible and in full functioning order.
## Server and Websites, a Global Commodity?


Managed Services Providers, IT Teams, IT Support rely on servers and websites for their business as well as day to day operations and to hold and manage their data. This is also increasingly true of public services, governmental or non-governmental organisations, charitable, academic, research or religious organisations, individuals plus countless other businesses, with no direct relation to IT.


## Staying Operational With Internet, Servers and Websites


Internet is by far one of the most widespread tools for any business, organisation or group today, however small or large. It is therefore not uncommon for a great proportion of businesses, organisations and groups of all sizes to need to make sure their servers and websites are up and running smoothly, whether they own or lease them.


## The Need for Simple Server Monitoring to Keep Updated on Servers and Websites

The target of developing simple efficient software is thus part of the companyâ€™s everyday aim. Simplicity has all its place in this current context.


Indeed, many people monitoring their websites or servers will be trained well-practiced IT technicians and agents used to the tools of their trade. Yet numerous others will not be up to date, have not got the technical knowledge but still need to keep on top of things somehow. And, whichever the situation, how often do staff teams have endless amounts of time to spend on learning how to use a new piece of software.
