Why [TSplus Server monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/) Is Crucial to e-Business?
Business over the internet has expanded by leaps and bounds and continues to do so. Congested websites and networks cause delays, even outages. Website Monitoring Essentials are needed to keep these problems at bay.
## Operational Issues Confronting e-Business Today:


E-business has become truly global for buyers and sellers alike, thanks to world economies opening up and growing IT possibilities. In addition, the associated problems, which are both technical and non-technical, are not set to slow down.


The prime concern for any e-business is secure and efficient handling of transaction volumes and high response levels. The problem is, slow loading time remains one of the main reasons potential on-line customers will switch web sites. Therefore, long waiting times can prove disastrous.


## Website Loading Times a Central Issue


Generally, a web site load pattern will vary from hour to hour due to standard work-hours. For example, lunch time and after hours load on an on-line super-store will be more than during working hours. Lengthy response times could result in on-line customers abandoning the cart midway and switching to the competition. These variations in bandwidth and network use and in load patterns means local response times can vary widely from place to place even for the same traffic volumes.


## Need for Website Monitoring Essentials to Keep Watch


Web site monitoring enables you to know in real time where the bottlenecks are, at any point in time. Constant monitoring is therefore a must to identify problems and initiate remedial steps without loss of time or on-line customers.


There are other problems as well. These relate to web site’s accessibility, availability, security, data integrity and dangers from hackers. Invariably, even with the best managed web sites it can be hard to know what the exact problem is and where! Until informed by a frustrated customer. Clearly, web site owners would prefer to concentrate on challenges posed by their business rather than spending time on these extraneous issues. For every web site, therefore, there is an urgent need for constant monitoring which can alert to specified issues and discrepancies.


## TSplus Server Monitoring as an Essential Tool for a Stable Website


[TSplus Server Monitoring](https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/) provides simple web site and server monitoring, helping address the issues and concerns raised above. It keeps you informed of the performance of your web sites. You can follow availability and accessibility and therefore highlight any deviations from the supplied norms. All that is left is to analyse these exceptions and takes appropriate remedial steps.


Consequently, any IT team can keep their applications running within target parameters and therefore more profitable. All of these detailed performance metrics can be edited into PDF reports. It is easy to choose the watched parameters for a given report. When you wish, Server Monitoring will compile this into a report on which you can then apply company branding. Thus, you can make other teams aware of network peak-times or quiet times, response-time curves, etc.


## TSplus Server Monitoring for Servers as Well as Websites


Similar items are monitored for servers, so you can see demands on the CPU or RAM, bottlenecks within application servers, user-presence, etc. and respond instantly in accordance. Technicians could use these on test servers and sites also, thus simulating particular circumstances. Such steps will help a business assess the impact of varying levels of use and demand, to tune up their infrastructure even before the web site launch. This results in better planning and preventive action so costly issues can be avoided.


## Simple and Ergonomic Website Monitoring Essentials


It is so intuitive to use Server Monitoring, that once it is installed, it takes mere seconds for monitoring to begin. Rapidly, a technician adds servers, supplies the URLs of the websites they wish to monitor and the process starts immediately. Server Monitoring will then check the web site(s) to ensure availability and the maintenance of acceptable levels of web server performance. It is up to the technician to personalise the norms which require Server Monitoring to send alerts.


## How Server Monitoring Keeps You Informed of Your Websites’ Performance


Defaults are the like of “disk write usage at 90%”, “CPU at 50% for … minutes” or “Website Response time superior to 500ms for at least 5 minutes”. If any of these fall outside the specified parameters, the notification process starts. Let’s take a simple example. Say Server Monitoring checks the time it takes for the web server to respond to the monitor’s request. It measures against the set acceptable response time (say 5 seconds). If a page takes more time to load, the agent is notified of a possible performance issue.


Similarly, sites are checked for availability. Server Monitoring notifies the supplied emails addresses or Teams contacts if any problem is detected. This TSplus software, therefore, provides a much needed non-stop monitoring service for smoother running of e-businesses.


## Conclusion on Website Monitoring Essentials


It is clear what the increasing customer preference for doing business on-line and the rapidly expanding global e-commerce implies!
