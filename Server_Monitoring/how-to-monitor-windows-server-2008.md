## Reasons to MonitoringÂ Windows Server 2008


IT technicians like to know their servers and networks are up and running smoothly. Therefore, any network needs monitoring, whether for peace of mind or efficiency. Indeed, system overload, lagging, downtime, etc. are amongst just a few problems sure to come up without monitoring. No matter how good a team's planning and scheduling might be.


Windows Server 2008, just like any other server, may have issues that can only be pi-pointed through monitoring. This leaves with all the how to questions relating to monitor a server, this one more specifically.


## What to Monitor in Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7


Similarly to its fellow-machine, Windows 7 devices will require monitoring. And just the same goes for websites. The aspects that technicians usually monitor are usage, of network, CPU and memory. Another important variable is disk input/output. Yet, no need to worry: there is a performance viewer within the Microsoft Management consoles of Windows 7 and Windows server 2008.


## How to Monitor Windows Server 2008


Here, you need to gather data, since data is what can show and help identify problems as they occur. So, let's get started. You need to access administrative tools, or your task manager. Firstly, tools like performance monitor are going to come in useful. Secondly, counters. These need to be set-up manually.


Steps to follow:


* in your "Start Menu", open the "Control Panel".
* There you will find "System and Security".
* Next, in "Administrative Tools",
* you can open "Performance Monitor".


Once inside the performance monitor window, you can refine your preferences.


You then have to validate this and make sure it runs, activating it within the performance monitor. To do this, in the "Data collector sets" scroll down to "Create data logs". You then need to check "Performance counters" and validate. As for counters, they are elements that need to be installed on any given device to be monitored. Think of them as the cookies of networking.
