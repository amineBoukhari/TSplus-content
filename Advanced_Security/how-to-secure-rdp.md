RDP is short for Remote Desktop Protocol. Microsoft introduced in 1998 and it has since evolved into what it is today. RDP makes remote access possible, enabling users to interact with their PC as though it were on another device. Because of this, it also has other uses, such as support. One question it has raised over the years is that of security. Do you want to know how to secure RDP? Read on to see what [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) can do for your IT set-up.
## Why the Need to Secure RDP?


Badly configured RDP is an inroad for cyber-attacks. Indeed, Remote Desktop Protocol is a networking protocol that enables distant viewing of the PC screen, use of its mouse and keyboard, etc. It communicates via TCP/IP and is designed to be used within a Local Area Network. 3389 is the port generally used to communicate, but that can be modified. The main security issue comes from leaving that port directly open to the Internet, and therefore to any attack.


The thing is, any outside contact opens a port outwards. Also, because of the potential uses of RDP and other remoting solutions, issues relating to users, devices and more all come into play.


## Uses for RDP


The principal use for RDP are sharing data and applications on servers within a company. This has been extended to remote work in all its forms, support teams, on-call staff and shift workers, and the likes of call-centers and help-desks.


SMBs are highly likely to use RDP since it is native to Windows devices and involves no additional cost as of itself. A typical scenario is that of a company with multiple premises all needing the same info at any given time.


## Steps to Take to Secure Remote Desktop Protocol


## Top 2 Cyber Security Steps


1. If there were only one fail-safe to implement, it would probably be longer more complex passwords. Gladly, there is no need to narrow things down so radically. Yet, for the sake of network security, this is a good priority. It is worth noting that current recommended minimum security is now: 12 character long passwords which use numbers and special characters, along with higher and lower case letters.
2. Since setting the requirements for passwords lies in the hands of the administrators, it is rapidly done. And the following step is in the same category: 2FA. There are many solutions to set-up multi-factor authentication. TSplus includes [two factor authentication](https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/) as part of its bundles or as a stand-alone product. This has to be the best second step in securing RDP.


That said, TSplus hasn't waited for passwords to be strengthened. Rather, our teams have taken the first step by providing TSplus Advanced Security with the Brute Force Defender feature. Its job is to stop brute-force attacks in their tracks, halting any username or password hijacking. Also, it locks your network from networks scanners and hackers.
## Further Steps to Make RDP Secure

4. Firewall. What needs to be said about this step... It is essential? Yes! Do you need to shop around to choose one? Probably not. Why go to any trouble when Windows Defender does the job very nicely and is already native to your devices. What's more, where this list of steps is concerned, TSplus Advanced Security covers every base including this one. The full description of our cyber-protection software can be found [here](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/).
5. Another important security step is TLS. It is the way HTTPS communicates so why use anything less secure since it has become standard. Though HTTP still stands, its more secure version has generally superceded it. HTTPS and TLS are good minimum standards to go with.
6. Another practical step admins can take is to limit the number of login attempts and to restrict login times. It is important to set low max attempts. Nonetheless, it needs to be a sensible amount so as to not constantly see passwords being reset. There is a mitigation on this solution though, since it could be used by attackers to narrow down potential user-names. A simple trick would be to restrict login attempts even for non-existant user-names.
7. Time restrictions are a great tool since they simply stop connections by a particular user outside their set hours. It won't be a possibility over the board. Indeed, certain users need the freedom to access the network at any time. But it will greatly reduce the potential threat zone.


TSplus Advanced Security comes with one more pin-pointed safe-guard. Homeland is a functionality whereby access can be restricted by country. Therefore, by allowing connections from only the known user-countries, another welcome jump is made towards securing RDP.
## Patch Management for safer RDP connection

9. It is common knowledge that patching goes a very long way to keep any devices safer. Security updates are of course designed to diminishing and even cut out specific recognised vulnerabilities and dangers. Regular patch management can too easily be overlooked but should be part of a set surveillance routine. It is thus well worth inserting it into your IT routines.


## Conclusion on How to Secure RDP


For an overall simple and secure experience, it is possible that the first and last step to mention is TSplus. That's what we believe.


Start with the TSplus Web-portal and all the great features included in Advanced Security. Then trust that blocking well over 300 million known malicious IPs is bound to help. Finally add each of the 7 steps covered above.


And yet, there is more to TSplus Advanced Security and how it can keep your network safe. Especially as we haven't talked price at all, while affordability is one of our pillars. **Try our it out for free for 15 days or find out more about it or any other of our products from our [website](https://tsplus.net/).**
