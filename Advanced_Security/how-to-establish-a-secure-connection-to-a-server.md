Establishing a secure connection to a server is essential to protect sensitive information from being intercepted, accessed or stolen by unauthorized users. There are several methods to establish a secure connection to a server, depending on the type of connection and services you need. In this article, we will explore some common methods and best practice for securing remote connections. That done, we will look at how [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) enhances any remote connection setup. Read on if you want to know how to establish a secure connection to a server.
## How to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server: 5 Common Methods


Here is a brief description of each of five quite common methods for securing remote connections.


### 1. SSH


One method for establishing a secure connection is using Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol with three layers (data and communication transport, authentication and connection). It provides secure remote login and command execution on a server. The encrypted communication tunnel it creates is secure.


To connect using SSH, you need an SSH client. For macOS and Linux, it is in the built-in terminal. Now, for Windows, you will need a third party client if you are on an older version but it is generally built in since Windows 10. Users can enter the server’s IP address or hostname, port number and authentication details for secure access.


### 2. VPN


Another method is using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the server. This allows for secure communication over the internet. To set up a VPN connection, users will need VPN client software and the VPN server’s configuration details. Follow the instructions provided by your VPN provider or network administrator to configure and connect to the VPN.


### 3. HTTPS


HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is another method for establishing a secure connection between the user's web browser and a web server. Ensure that the URL starts with https:// instead of http:// when accessing a website or web service. This has become standard, so modern web browsers display a padlock icon in the address bar to indicate a secure connection.


### 4. SSL/TLS


Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with SSL/TLS can be used to secure the connection between the client and server when using RDP to connect to a remote server. To configure the Remote Desktop Gateway server for SSL/TLS authentication and encryption, users can use SSL/TLS certificates. Ensure that the Remote Desktop Connection client is set to use SSL/TLS security.


### 5. FTPS or SFTP


Finally, when transferring files to/from a server, you have the option of using File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) instead of regular FTP. FTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption, while SFTP uses SSH for secure file transfers. Use a compatible client like FileZilla to connect to the server using the appropriate protocol, server address, port, and authentication credentials.


## Drawback to Using Only One Method to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server


The above methods function. Yet, they lack a broader aspect: overall management. For one off or individual use, each has benefits. Nevertheless, if you plan on extending them company-wide, some automation is needed. You will also gain from a capacity to oversee the whole network and make sure everything remains sturdily protected.
