 Cyber-crime is more and more sophisticated. With Internet and its good and bad opportunities growing daily, such threats are not set to go away. To secure Windows RDP against hackers and malware, IT services most definitely need stronger protection methods. They also need security that will learn and evolve with them.## Securing Microsoft Remote Desktop for Working Away


The growing trend of globe-trotting workers, shared offices and the like has seen the variety of cyber-threats increase hand-in-hand. In the light of this, [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) has been improved to provide one of the most reliable protections available. Indeed, look to decrease your network’s vulnerable points and sleep easier with Advanced Security's powerful cybersecurity functions.


Cybersecurity software programs are essential security measures for any remote server. Unprotected, RDP is actually an open inroad for hackers and attacks. TSplus Advanced Security provides admins with great tools to block hackers as well as to secure your Windows workstations and your Windows web servers.


## Disable Access From Specific Countries:


You most likely know where your customers and users are located. Why let uninvited parties connect from countries the other side of the globe if there is no reason to do so?


Homeland Protection lets admins promptly and conveniently limit incoming connections to the countries essential for your businesses processes. It achieves this using country-based whitelisting, cutting off connections from anywhere else.


## Protection From Brute Force Attacks:


Our Bruteforce Protection stops aggressive forays just about immediately and quarantines infected areas. Your web server will no longer need to process thousands of failed login efforts, thus also saving resources. A combination of whitelists as well as restrictions combine to stop unauthorised login attempts.


## Block Known Malicious IPs:


Whatever your Windows device or server, make use of our pre-blocked list of over 380 million known malicious IP addresses. With this list, TSplus Advanced Security will automatically nip hackers’ attempts in the bud. At last, the sentry needed to guard remote connections and devices. What’s more, the IP address list is searchable and editable. This makes address monitoring simple. The blocked list is regularly updated, hence our Support and Updates service.


## Defence Against Ransomware:


Ransomware assaults are still a major hazard. Indeed, numerous companies are still ill-equipped to take care of the threat. This motivates extortion demands and data stealth. Many are prepared to pay in the hope of receiving the decryption crucial to recovering their network or data.


Because of a relative absence of correct defence and understanding, Ransomware remains a favourite among cyber criminals. Typical ransoms paid to cyber criminals by companies affected has nearly tripled in the last year. [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/) has been improved to supply highly sophisticated anti-ransomware defence.


## Extra Tips to Stop Hackers in Their Tracks


Phishing emails are another top threat. Experts therefore suggest that employees be trained to identify risks. Improving cybersecurity habits is key to maintaining company information secure. And with brute-force vying to stay top of the cyber-crime league-table, we have three more swords for the fight.


It is always worth reminding all staff, customers, users and anyone else that solid passwords are paramount. To that we will add multi-factor verification: we provide Two-Factor Authentication as a separate product. That way you can benefit from it even if you have not yet adopted our other products. Finally, do keep up with regular safety and security fixes (Microsoft or other) to protect your network against assailants who would exploit any recognized vulnerabilities.


## Firewall to Increase Protection for RDP


All these attributes and also even more are included in TSplus Advanced Security. It is a standalone product, offering powerful protection features. It ensures web servers, information and customers remain secure whether using TSplus or any other software.


We recently added its very own built-in firewall! To enable it, open the "Advanced settings" tab of the AdminTool then change "Use Windows Firewall" to "No" in “Product settings”. This will automatically turn on the Advanced Security firewall.
