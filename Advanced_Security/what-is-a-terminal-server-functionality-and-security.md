Today's business landscape revolves around IT and all things digital, whether from near or far. Many businesses and organisations rely, sometimes entirely, on networked computer systems for efficient data management and seamless communication. Terminal servers play a crucial role in this context by enabling remote access and centralised control over applications and resources.

In this article, we will delve into the question: “what is a terminal server”. We will look at its functionality and the importance of securing servers in a networked environment. Additionally, we will rapidly explore [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) and other TSplus software solutions that contribute to building, managing and enhancing business networks.
## Understanding TS: What are Terminal Servers?


A terminal server is a hardware or software-based solution that facilitates remote access to applications and data stored on a centralised server. What Microsoft first introduced as Terminal Services is now known as Remote Desktop Services. In practice, it acts as an intermediary between end-user devices, such as computers, laptops or thin clients, and the actual server infrastructure.


Terminal servers enable multiple users to simultaneously access the same server, creating a cost-effective and scalable solution for businesses. Indeed, instead of installing applications on each individual devices, users connect to the terminal server and access their desktop environments, files and software remotely, including any applications. This centralisation simplifies management, enhances data security and streamlines software updates and maintenance.


## Benefits and Use Cases of a Terminal Server


Terminal servers offer numerous benefits to businesses of all sizes across various industries. Here are some key advantages:


1. **Cost Efficiency:** By using a terminal server, businesses can extend the lifespan of their existing hardware. Indeed, processing power is concentrated in the server infrastructure. Therefore, this divides the number of device upgrades and significantly lowers maintenance costs.
2. **Enhanced Security:** Terminal servers centralise data storage and application access, allowing for robust security measures to be implemented on the server level. Users can access sensitive information remotely without the risk of data loss or theft. This is an essential in the event of a device being lost or compromised.
3. **Improved Collaboration:** Terminal servers enable multiple users to work simultaneously on the same applications and files, fostering collaboration and boosting productivity. Teams can pool information, work on projects together, easily exchanging data.
4. **Remote Access:** Terminal servers enable employees to access their work environments and applications from any location, provided they have an internet connection. This flexibility promotes remote work, enhances mobility, and ensures business continuity during unforeseen circumstances.


## Practical Aspects of Terminal Server Security


Now we have looked at what a terminal server is and seen some use cases, it is time to see some questions raised in their wake. These are mainly due to device and Internet related aspects of terminal servers and their nature. The physical machine amounts to a box which non-technicians might say resembles a router. It presents many sockets. Where wires plug in, so lines lead in and out of the box. What this entails is in fact a considerable security issue.


This concept of “line in-line out” would provide a field-day for hackers and other cyber-threats. Hence an important matter: a terminal server used to be quite simple for LAN purposes but needs to be secure and protected if it is to be part of a network. This is true even if only a part of the network will face Internet, its possibilities and its dangers.


## Securing Networked Servers with TSplus Advanced Security


When it comes to networked servers with internet access, robust security measures are thus paramount. This is necessary to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorised access. TSplus Advanced Security provides a comprehensive solution to safeguard servers from external threats. Its key features include:


1. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** TSplus Advanced Security acts as an intrusion detector. Indeed, it monitors network traffic and detects suspicious activities or intrusion attempts in real-time, it watches processes and blocks dangerous IPs, and more. This proactive approach enables prompt responses and minimises the risk of security breaches.
2. **Two-factor Authentication (2FA):** Implementing 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a unique code sent to their mobile device. This mitigates the risk of unauthorised access even if passwords were compromised.
3. **[Brute-Force Attack Protection:](https://docs.dl-files.com/advanced-security/advanced-bruteforce)** TSplus Advanced Security protects against brute-force attacks by automatically blocking IP addresses that exhibit suspicious login behaviour. This prevents hackers from repeatedly attempting to gain access through the server's login interface.


## Additional TSplus Software Solutions


In addition to TSplus Advanced Security, [TSplus offers a range of software solutions](https://tsplus.net/) for efficient remote support, simple affordable application publishing and enhanced server monitoring. These are:
