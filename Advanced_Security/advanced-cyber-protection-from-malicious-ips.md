## TSplus Advanced Security: Safeguarding Your IT Infrastructure


In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is paramount for IT professionals and companies seeking to protect their networks from the ever-evolving threats of cybercrime. TSplus Advanced Security offers a comprehensive solution to fortify your defences and ensure the safety of your systems. In this article, we'll explore two key features that make our software an indispensable tool for safeguarding your IT infrastructure. Delve with me into Hacker IP Protection and Global IP Management with [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/).
## Hacker IP Protection: Crowd-Sourced Security by TSplus


Hacker IP Protection is your shield against known threats. These include online attacks, service abuse, malware, botnets and other cybercrimes. This feature harnesses the collective knowledge of the Advanced Security community to automatically blacklist over 368 million identified threats upon implementation.


From then on, it is updated daily, as the event will tell you within your Advanced Security Window mentioning “Synchronised Hacker IP addresses…”. This event takes place upon activation of the software. You can also click the “Refresh Hacker IP” button to synchronise manually whenever you see fit.


* **Block Malicious IP Addresses:** Keep your system protected by automatically blocking recognised threats, bolstering your defences against cyberattacks.
* **Community-Powered Security:** Hacker IP Protection relies on the vigilance of the Advanced Security user community to ensure that all blacklisted IPs are genuine threats, minimising false positives.
* **Automated Updates:** The feature updates daily, providing you with real-time protection against emerging threats.


## Guide to Hacker IP Protection with TSplus Advanced Security


To harness the power of [Hacker IP Protection](https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/advanced-security/hacker-ip) and never miss an update:


1. **Subscription Required:** Ensure you have an active Support and Updates Services subscription to access this feature.
2. **Automatic Updates:** Hacker IP Protection updates automatically every day, keeping your system and data safe from the latest threats.
3. **Manual Update:** If need be, you can manually update from the "Blocked IP Addresses" tab by clicking the "Refresh Hacker IP" button./p>


## Global IP Management: Advanced Security Simplifies Access Control


Managing IP addresses effectively is at the core of network security. TSplus Advanced Security's Global IP Management feature streamlines this process, offering a unified allow/block list that simplifies access control.


**Easy Management:** With TSplus Advanced Security, you can effortlessly manage both blocked and whitelisted IP addresses using only one list. This single list centralises everything to simplify the task of keeping your network secure.


**Search Bar:** The built-in search bar allows you to conveniently locate and manage IP addresses. For instance, if you were looking for blocked addresses, for instance, you would simply enter "blocked" in the search bar. All blocked IPs would then be displayed by the filter.


**IP Address Description:** Assign meaningful descriptions to IP addresses to identify them quickly in the future. Thus-naming important addresses makes it easier to keep track of your access list.


**Multi-address Editing:** TSplus Advanced Security enables you to add multiple blocked IP addresses to your whitelist with a single action, enhancing efficiency in access management. To do this, use the “add existing to whitelist” tab.


It is worth noting that, by default, server localhosts addresses are whitelisted, as are IPV4 and IPV6.

## Implementation Guide for Global IP Management with TSplus


One way to make the most of Global IP Management is using command line.


* **Whitelist IPs:** With command line it is straightforward to whitelist one IP address as well as to whitelist all the addresses within a given range. Here is the syntax to follow:



```
TSplus-Security.exe addwhitelistedip [ip addresses] [optional description]
```
* **Multiple IPs and IP Ranges:** If you wish to specify multiple IP addresses, IP address ranges or even add descriptions for each rule, you simply use colon or semi-colon to separate the values Here is an example:



```
TSplus-Security.exe addwhitelistedip 1.1.1.1;2.2.2.2;3.3.3.1-3.3.6.12;5.5.5.5 "John's workplaces"
```

As you see, the syntax is x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y delimitated by a semi-colon.
* **Block IPs:** Blocking IP Addresses is a similar process. To blocking IP addresses, the command follows the syntax:



```
TSplus-Security.exe blockips [ip addresses] [optional description]
```
* **Unblock IPs:** Unblocking IP Addresses, once more, uses similar syntax, whether for one or more IP addresses. Follow this example:



```
TSplus-Security.exe unblockips [ip addresses]
```


Note that this command won't affect IP addresses blocked by Hacker IP Protection. Unblocking one of the addresses pre-blocked by Hacker IP Protection requires actually whitelisting it.
