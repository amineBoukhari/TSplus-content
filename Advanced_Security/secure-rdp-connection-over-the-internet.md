It is no secret that RDP is an inroad for hacking if it is open to the Internet. Threats generally aim to steal data, identity, credentials and so on, often as a way to steal or blackmail money and sometimes sensitive information. Luckily, there are tools to keep RDP protected. Available solutions range from using software or credentials to virtually secure it, to physically setting it one step removed from the Web. Here are some ways to securely use RDP connection over the Internet.
## Why Secure RDP Connection over the Internet


Why should everyone feel that IT and Internet security is their concern? Sadly, RDP turned out to be a loophole in the Windows operating system security. Soon after its inception, it became common knowledge that malevolent software could use RDP to use and spy on any server’s connections. Therefore, this poses a threat to most servers. It leaves them prey to hackers, network scanners, brute force robots and the like.


Unless you have secured your server and connections, that is. Hence why protection is so important. Of course, knowing what to watch out for and watching at the time is also helpful. It is even better if a program will do that for you. Otherwise, “infection” can take place nearly invisibly.


To efficiently counter cyber-threats, you need an anti-spyware program. Windows, of course, has its own safeguard, "Windows Defender," which uses both preventative and corrective measures to protect you. Simple, yet, there is better still. Simple and powerful are two of the characteristics TSplus aims to build into its software, especially when it comes to security.


## Some Specific Weaknesses in RDP Security


Clicking on a malicious link in an email or on a website can allow undesirable programs to attempt to install and execute. Furthermore, this risk is particularly high when you open an RDS session. Robots scan open ports and attempt to steal your identity to log in. External IPs are known to automatically test hundreds to thousands of combinations. They do that by trying hundreds of combinations on your server every minute. These consist of typical, default and current logins and passwords and may also include other data they stole previously.


## ID Verification for a Secure RDP Connection Over the Internet


User credentials are a great way to ensure safer Internet communication, especially when you need to safeguard data and information.
