**The Root of the Trouble with Internet and Security**


The whole meaning of networking is to share programs and information. But granting others access to a computer device of any kind reveals an open window for those with foul motives, too. In the early days, networks were quite secure because they were closed-in systems. So, to do any harm you had to get physical access to a server wired to the LAN.

Remote access and Internet connections have changed that. Broader availability and falls in the cost of broadband or other Internet connections mean that even home computers can remain linked up to the Internet round-the-clock, which increases the chances for hackers to gain access to them.

## Internet as a Door Without a Key

Computer operating systems were originally planned for stand-alone computers only, not networked ones, and security was not an issue. When computer networking came about, applications and operating systems concentrated on easy accessibility rather than security. Because of this earlier focus on accessibility; security was mostly retrofitted into hardware systems.

## Cyber-Security: Building Locks onto a Key-free System

Modern operating systems are planned and built with security in mind, but they still have to operate using conventional networking protocols. The fact these still bear the same weaknesses they were found to have can result in security problems.

## Finding the Balance Between Security and Access

Security versus access. The users want easy access to resources on the network. Administrators want the network to remain secure. These two goals are at odds. Because access and security are always on conflicting ends of the security scale, the more access you have, the less safe the network can be.

For business computer networks, the key is to hit a balance. On one hand, make sure employees are not annoyed by security measures. And on the other, maintain a level of protection that will keep unauthorized individuals from getting access. At TSplus, we think we've struck that balance with [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/).

## Types of Internal Threats to a Network

Internal network security threats are those that come from within the organization, as opposed to those that come through the Internet. Internal threats can include employees who on purpose attempt to steal data or bring in viruses or attacks on the computer network. often these events will happen by lack of care and due attention, in part because sometimes the threats are not so well known.

Other internal threats are posed by outside employees (contract workers, janitorial services and people posing as utility company employees) who have physical access to the LAN computers.

Though, many internal threats are unintended. Employees may install or use their own software or hardware for a private purpose, unaware that it poses a security threat to their computers and the complete network.

## Type of External Threats to a Network

External security threats are those that come from outside the LAN, typically from the Internet. These threats are the ones we usually think of when we talk about hackers and computer network attacks. Such people can make use of flaws and characteristics of computer operating systems and software applications. They take advantage of the way various network communications protocols work. Malicious software will try to use these to do such things as:

* Enter a system and access its data. It will then most likely attempt to read, copy, change or delete some or all of it.
* Break down a system and harm or destroy operating system and application files so they do not work anymore.
* Install one or more viruses and worms that can spread to other systems across the LAN.
* Or use the system to start attacks against other systems or networks.
