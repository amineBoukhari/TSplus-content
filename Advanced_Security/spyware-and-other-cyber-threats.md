**Spyware: A Threat That Won’t Go Away**


As spyware threats continue to grow, the methods by which users are infected becomes less and less difficult. It no longer takes obtaining physical access to a computer nor do users have to click on an ad or email attachment to cause the installation of a malicious application. Spyware and ransomware can easily be picked up by simply visiting a web site. It finds its way onto computers commonly when users download freeware or shareware. When you download these programs, spyware and adware are frequently installed invisibly. Thankfully, [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) is at hand.


## Signs of a Spyware Infection and What is Threatened


You may begin to notice more pop ups and slower computer functions once spyware has infected your system. Spyware moves through your computer and monitors your internet habits, then the information is sent to a third party. This third party will most likely use it for advertising purposes. More serious types of spyware are capable of recording each keystroke you make on your computer. This means every chat or email message as well as passwords, social security and credit card number are all recorded by the intruder. These gather what they need to access accounts and worse steal money and even identities.


## Some Types of Spyware and Cyber Threats


Being aware of threats means you can be more careful and better prepared. Several different types exist: spyware, ransomware and so on, which makes catching and removing the invasive applications even more difficult.


Adware is one of the most common forms of cyber threat. It works by sending you pop-up ad after pop-up ad for various products and services while you are online. Adware also monitors your internet surfing habits and sells that information to other parties who then use it to bombard you with junk emails and spam.


Another form of attack comes as browser hijackers. These applications can get into your computer and change your start page and preferred search engine to a site full of ads or adult material. Browser hijackers are typically also data miners which report all of your internet browsing habits to a central database that is sold to other parties.


One of the most dangerous and malicious type of programs is keyloggers, which are used mostly for identity theft and credit card fraud. Keyloggers can record every piece of information you type in your computer from credit card numbers to social security numbers and banking information. These do the most damage financially and are amongst the worst causes of identity theft.


Finally, a costly form of spyware that users have to deal with is the modem hijacker. Also known as dialers, these applications install themselves so they can use your internet connection to dial long distance or premium rate phone numbers. By unknowingly dialing these remote areas from your Internet connexion, you are the one charged for the outrageous rates.


## Fending Off Spyware and Other Cyber Threats


There are yet other types of cyber-threats, but those cover a wide enough range for this time. When a cyber attack takes place on your system, you need to be able to stop it in its tracks and root it out. To remove any current spyware infections, users need to obtain anti-spyware programs. These programs can scan your system, compile a list of infected files and remove them to restore normal setting and functioning.


Of course, there are some very decent free spyware tools, some of which work well together in catching all possible spyware infections, but these are rarely scalable for businesses, let alone larger companies. **At this stage, [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) will take its first amazing step towards making your system secure:** it will quarantine and curtail the action of any spyware. It can even notice it before it comes into action due to its silent learning time by which it will increasingly differentiate the usual users from unknown exterior visits.


## Watching Out For Potential Sources of Spyware and Other Cyber Threats


To avoid future spyware threats from infecting your computer, do not click on links or ads offering free movies, competitions, prizes, etc.. Also, very importantly, to download software, choose your sources with great care, making sure a site is trustworthy and that you are on the real website, and not a fake. Indeed, one of the things to watch out for are links and websites which are made to look similar to big names. Typing errors in the URL can be a give-away that the site is a malicious copy. On paying closer attention, you may notice small insidious differences that can be missed when going too fast or not reading them precisely. This is a means malicious persons often use to mislead users onto their malware, spyware and other attacks. As [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) blocks a seemingly endless list of known malicious IPs, a good number of these threats will be thwarted before they happen.


## A firewall to Help Keep You PC Safer


Installing and keeping a firewall activated on your computer can help reduce the amount of cyber-infections. And having a good anti-virus program is essential, although it cannot detect most forms of spyware it will help keep your computer more secure. A fine place to start is with a PC's in-built Windows Defender. Tsplus Advanced Security will be the only other protection your system will need.
