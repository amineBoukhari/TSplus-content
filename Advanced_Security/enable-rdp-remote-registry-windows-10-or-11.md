Finally, before wrapping up, you will find the necessary steps to activate Remote Registry and RDP.
## What is the Windows Registry?


In Windows, the Registry is a database of configuration settings and options, stored hierarchically. These are applicable to the Windows operating system, but also to the hardware and to installed software. Therefore, the Registry is crucial for Windows and to its applications functioning correctly. This makes it all the more important that it be only accessible by persons who are both authorised and well versed in what to modify (or not) and how.


* **Block Malicious IP Addresses:** Keep your system protected by automatically blocking recognised threats, bolstering your defences against cyberattacks.
* **Community-Powered Security:** Hacker IP Protection relies on the vigilance of the Advanced Security user community to ensure that all blacklisted IPs are genuine threats, minimising false positives.
* **Automated Updates:** The feature updates daily, providing you with real-time protection against emerging threats.


## Understanding the Role of the Windows Registry


So, the Windows registry serves as a centralized database housing critical configuration settings for the operating system, hardware and software. Consequently, this database plays a pivotal role in maintaining system functionality. Within the Registry, IT administrators can remotely access and modify registry entries on target systems. For example, the Remote Registry service is essential for running certain tools which would be disabled in the event of a faulty modification.


## The Importance of "Remote" for the Registry and IT Pros Everywhere


As we now know, the Registry service is vital to the Windows OS. But it is also an asset for IT experts, especially the fact it is Remote. When an authorised user is able to access the registry remotely for particular tasks rather than need to attend to the machine in person, it either simplifies certain tasks or just making them possible.


It grants the capability to remotely control and modify registry settings on remote Windows servers and client computers. This capability is key in implementing fixes and carrying out maintenance. Additionally, it streamlines administrative tasks such as configuration management and software deployment. What more do you need for enabling RDP Remote Registry to be a must-know for IT professionals.


## Measured Actions when Remoting into Windows 10 or 11 Registry


To enable RDP Remote Registry on Windows 10 and 11, you must navigate through specific steps. It is important to note that this feature is disabled by default for security reasons. Therefore, enabling it requires careful consideration and adherence to best practice.


* **Permission to access the Remote Registry Service:** To initiate the process, ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify registry settings on the target system. Essentially you will need your administrator credentials for both machines, including the hostname of the remote PC.
* **Default Access:** By default, only members of the groups “administrators” and “backup operators” have access to the registry remotely. This restricts unauthorized access. [TSplus](https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/advanced-security/permissions) adds extra protection to these restrictions.
* **Administrator Rights:** Remember that reserving certain actions to administrators is never an empty process. Modifications to the Windows registry should not bedone lightly since they can break the system. At one point or another of any of the following paths to Remote Registry, there will be a question of administrator rights, passwords etc.
* **Know-how:** Before you begin, ensure you know what you are about to do, why, how to go about it safely for the system, etc. It seems sensible to back up first too.


## Final Security Considerations with Remote Registry on Windows


While RDP Remote Registry offers valuable administrative capabilities, as described, it poses potential security concerns. That is why it is available but inactive by default. For this additional reason, it is often recommended to disable network access to the registry, especially in high-security environments. Unauthorized changes to the registry are indeed likely to disrupt system operations. Hence why it is essential to weigh the benefits against the risk when going about activation and any changes. It is also paramount to monitor such services so you can pick up at the earliest possible stage any untoward Registry activity.
## Securing Devices with TSplus Advanced Security in the Remote Registry Context


TSplus Advanced Security provides essential security for your devices in this context. Indeed, enabling remote access is a necessity for efficient system management and preventing external attacks while you work in remote registry is paramount. However, remotely intervening in Windows registry simultaneously increases the exposure to external tampering. This potential security risk is where [TSplus Advanced Security steps in](https://tsplus.net/pricing/), without breaking the bank.


By leveraging the capabilities of TSplus Advanced Security, IT professionals can implement a multi-layered defense strategy that mitigates the risk of external attacks. Our advanced security solution employs various mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of critical system data, such as the Windows registry.


## Activation and Configuration of RDP and Remote Registry – Windows 10 or 11


### Option 1, Registry Editor:


If Windows registry services and RDP are enabled, you can remote in and perform these actions via remote access.


Windows 11 and 10 have a preinstalled registry editor which you can find as you normally would on a PC. You might reach the tool:


1. using the **Search**;
2. browsing from the **control panel** (It should be accessible from the Windows tool under System and Security.);
3. and alternately you can use **Run** (Simultaneously press the Windows key and R then enter regedit and validate.);
4. **Windows Terminal** or
5. the **Task Manager**.
6. There are more paths to follow including creating a hotkey or shortcut. These last two make it a little too easy in my mind, unless this really is an action you need to carry out very frequently.


Once you are in the Registry Editor tool, you can carry out the needed verifications or modifications.


**NB:** It is worth noting that certain changes that you implement directly into the registry will not configure related actions or apps which would be modified by a “standard” set-up of the item. Think of it as a domino trail: certain actions push more than one button but working up the trail will not press those downstream, just as the domino will not knock over those in its back.


### Option 2, Command Lines for Enabling RDP Remote Registry access - Windows 10 and 11:


However, it is possible to use command lines to implement a series of changes, step by step, to activate RDP directly from the registry. Therefore, you can choose to do the background work there.


One thing to remember, is how this may trigger anti-virus reactions. Indeed, PsExec is the tool you need for this option, but... Since it has often been used by malware, it will likely cause your guards to raise their shield at you. And, if you are not a programmer at heart, with precision down to the hilt, then beware that dash you forgot and the consequences it may have.


That said, PsExec has its uses since it makes the impossible possible: activating a de-activated protocol, from afar.


To begin with, these steps imply you working within your LAN. You need to log into the registry of the remote computer, therefore have admin rights to both devices you are using.


1. Here, your first action will be disabling the firewall, preferably only on the ports used by RDP.
2. The next action will be to enable Remote Desktop. For that, you can continue using PsExec or move on to opening the Registry Editor. Either way, you need to change the DenyTS connections command value from 1 to 0.
3. Now RDP is enabled, you can proceed to launch RDS and use your admin credentials to connect.


### Option 3, Enabling RDP Remote Registry access - Windows 10 and 11 with PowerShell:


It is also possible to go down the PowerShell route. For today, I will leave it to your favourite research engine for the information and steps for this option. Nevertheless, I wanted to include it to complete the range of choices.
