## Opening Businesses to the Internet – Remote Working


**Today, businesses are taking advantage of the Internet to deliver their apps and services to users in ways that weren’t possible 20 years ago. For many businesses, offering remote working has been a necessity to effectively compete with other businesses in their market.**
Web-based access offers many advantages for your company. For example, it can enable you to serve a wider range of users without the associated expansion of corporate office space. Integrating the Internet in your business can also mean increased profits and decreased cost of operations.
## Internet Security Issues Raised by Remote Access


However, [Remote Desktop](https://tsplus.net/) and web-enabled apps need proper deployment planning and tools to be safe and secure. With more and more businesses turning to a web delivery model for their corporate applications, hackers and other bad actors have targeted remote desktop services as a way to wreak havoc and steal information.


## Cyber-security against Cyber-crime


Remote environments of all types can be vulnerable to this kind of crime. Exposing corporate servers to the internet makes your services more widely available – but it does carry some inherent risks if not done properly.


This is why it is so important that businesses get an internet security program for their remote working infrastructure. Protecting businesses from malicious software and people who want to gain access to crucial business data brings us to TSplus Advanced Security.


## TSplus Advanced Security – All-in-One Cyber-Security Tool


Today, there are very few Internet security programs that you can take advantage of to protect your remote desktop servers from hackers, ransomware, and other intrusions. Most of the security programs available are targeted at viruses. And while helpful, that single functionality does not cover the biggest threats that internet-facing enterprises face.


This is why you we recommend you look for an Internet security software program that can effectively protect servers from all types of risks circulating the Internet today. [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) is such a product. We designed it to keep our Remote Access and Remote Support users safe on every front while they are online using our software.


## Protection Against Numerous Online Dangers


Beyond viruses, here are three of the main threats faced by remote infrastructures today:


• **Brute Force Attacks –** A classic attack method that any internet-facing server can be subject to. Repeated attempts to guess login credentials. Usually run by automated bots. Not only a security risk if the attack is successful since the simple existence of the attack can negatively impact server performance.


• **Ransomware Attacks –** The last 5 years have seen a plague of ransomware attacks in both private and public spheres. Businesses and governments alike are being shaken down by internet gangs for millions of dollars to recover maliciously encrypted information. Remote working infrastructures require particular care to protect them against such attacks.


• **Coordinated Intrusion Attempts –** While similar to brute force attacks, coordinated intrusion attempts are generally targeted, and sometimes involve more human intervention. These types of attacks often come from known hacker groups with equally well-known IP clusters from which their activity originates.


## Winning Combination for Cybersecurity


**These are just a few of the types of attacks against which TSplus Advanced Security was designed to protect your IT and remote infrastructure. When combined with the Two-Factor Authentication functionality of TSplus Remote Access, client connections are secure, users are safe and corporate data is protected.**
