Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has long been a popular method for remotely accessing computers and servers. It allows users to connect to a remote desktop from anywhere in the world, providing a convenient and efficient way to work remotely. However, the security of RDP connections has regularly been a concern. This has historically lead organisations to seek secure alternatives or complements to prioritize data protection and confidentiality.

Read on for a secure alternative to Windows RDP. Indeed, in this article, we will explore the advantages and potential issues of Windows RDP. We will then introduce [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) as a robust solution for enhancing the security of remote connections.
## Understanding Windows RDP and Its Advantages:


Windows RDP is a built-in feature of the Windows operating system that enables users to access and control remote computers. It offers several advantages, including:


* Remote Access: RDP allows users to access their desktops and applications remotely, providing flexibility and mobility. It enables remote workers to remain productive. Indeed, they can connect to their work environment from any location.
* Collaborative Working: RDP facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to connect to the same remote desktop simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful for team projects and troubleshooting tasks.
* Cost-Effective: Since RDP is a built-in feature, there is no need for additional software licenses or investments. Consequently, it is a cost-effective solution for remote access.


## Disadvantages and Security Issues of Windows RDP


However, in spite of its benefits, Windows RDP has been associated with security vulnerabilities that can expose organizations to various risks.
Potential Issues with Windows RDP:


* Brute-Force Attacks: RDP has been a target for brute-force attacks, where hackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different username and password combinations.
* Weak Authentication: RDP often relies on authentication methods such as single-factor username and password. Unfortunately, these leave potential inroads which mean RDP security can be easily compromised.
* Exploitable Vulnerabilities: Windows RDP has been targeted by numerous exploits and vulnerabilities over the years, which have lead to unauthorized access, data breaches and system compromise.


## Introducing TSplus Advanced Security as an Alternative for Secure Remote Connections


Nevertheless, the picture does not have to be that bleak. To address the security concerns associated with Windows RDP, TSplus offers an innovative solution: TSplus Advanced Security. This powerful tool enhances the security of remote connections, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring a robust defence against cyber threats.


## Securing RDP Connectivity with TSplus Advanced Security


[TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) incorporates several key features that mitigate the risks associated with traditional RDP. Here are a hand-picked few:


1. Brute-Force Attacks Protection: TSplus Advanced Security protects against brute-force attacks by monitoring and analysing login attempts in real-time. It can automatically blacklist IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behaviour, effectively blocking potential attackers.
2. Ransomware and Malware Protection: The Advanced Security solution employs intelligent behavioural analysis to detect and prevent ransomware and malware attacks. It actively monitors system activity and can block suspicious processes. That is how it prevents unauthorized access and data loss.
3. Server Access Control: With TSplus Advanced Security, administrators have granular control over user access rights and permissions. They can define access policies based on user roles and implement restrictions. This, in turn, ensures that only authorized individuals can connect to sensitive resources.
4. [Two-Factor Authentication](https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/): Advanced Security is part of our remote access and control software suite. As part of it, you can benefit from 2FA. By implementing two-factor authentication, TSplus adds an extra layer of security to RDP connections. Users are required to provide a second authentication factor in addition to their username and password. Examples of these: fingerprint, smart card, mobile app-generated code... This is an important extra step towards cyber-security.


## Conclusion on Secure Alternative to Windows RDP


While Windows RDP has been a popular method for remote access, security concerns have prompted the search for more secure alternatives. TSplus Advanced Security offers a comprehensive solution that enhances the security of RDP connections. Protect your company devices and infrastructures from cyber threats. Ensure your business the confidentiality and integrity of its data.


By implementing features such as brute-force protection and ransomware prevention, [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) provides peace of mind for businesses relying on remote connectivity. With TSplus Advanced Security, organisations can leverage the benefits of remote access while prioritizing the security of their systems and sensitive information.
