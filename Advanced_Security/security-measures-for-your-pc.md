Just like a network, data on an individual PC needs vigilance. With Internet access, data is at considerable risk from spyware and other cyber threats. There is no better time than now to eliminate risks by securing your PC.

Anonymity of the net is not enough protection. Today’s dangers on the Web are such that there are inroads for hackers and the like. No matter whether they aim to gain access and steal data, implant data or dangerous viruses, use your PC’s RAM and resources to their ends, and who knows what else.

Keep your guard up with [TSplus Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/).

 

Gladly, there are simple steps for ensuring good system protection and peace of mind. Many of these extend to aspects of network use when you think of it.


## 1: Set effective passwords for all users.


A password should be of minimum of 8 characters and contain upper case and lower case characters, be alpha-numeric and include at least one special character such as punctuation signs, percentage, currency signs, etc. It is better to avoid words or dates, especially if they are easily guessed (user, admin, …).


Uncrackable passwords are the key: uppercase in the middle not just at the beginning as well as inter-spaced numbers. [2FA](https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/) is a brilliant additional tool in this fight to protect credentials.


Major accounts that need protection are the administrator account but also any others created during the installation of Windows.


## 2: Make wise and scant use of administrator accounts.


Change user passwords by logging in using administrator privileges but avoid using the administrator account for general use and browsing. This will keep an extra layer of security between all administrator rights and the main source of danger and trouble: exchanges with the Internet. If ever an attack takes place stealing passwords and other credentials, this will buy extra time to notice and crack down on the threat before it can get to the core of your device.


## 3: Prevent break ins or use of security scanners by installing a firewall.


This is a software or hardware device that is configured to detect and prevent unauthorized or remote access to the computer. A firewall notes the address from which an access request is received and then permits or denies access. Generally, all home Internet sharing systems have an inbuilt firewall such as Windows Defender. Nonetheless, software firewalls are available online, though it is worth bearing in mind to make sure the source is trustworthy before choosing.


## 4: Install antivirus software.


Antivirus software will scan the system automatically once a week and check any e-mails that seem suspicious. Be sure to periodically update the program: computer viruses proliferate each day. Many antivirus programs update themselves automatically.


## 5: Be vigilant about spyware and adware.


These programs collect data and advertise products. They are installed without permission and collect data from computer for use in marketing. To curtail such practices, use a reputable spyware finding tool. Many spyware finding tools are available free.


## 6: Block all security lapses or holes in Windows.


As any device or network will only be as strong as its weakest entry-point, this is paramount. These weaknesses are exploited by malicious users to infect computer systems shutting them down and spreading to other associated systems. Use tools like security patches provided by the manufacturer of your operating system to remove dangers.


## 7: Change the user-name of the administrative account.


It has full control of the files and system settings. It is usually named Admin or administrator by default, which is as easily guessed as 0000 or 1234 for a mobile. As this account is a main target to hackers, renaming the account strengthens security measures and will help protect your system.


## 8: Disable ‘hidden shares” if present in your operating system.


This used to be present in Windows 2000 as well as XP. This permitted others with the username and password to remotely access all your files and data. Recent operating systems have RDP and RDS. These are in a way descendants of the original sharing protocols, but they now should be functions that require activating and enabling.


For safer use of these facilities, [Advanced Security](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) can keep watch.


## 9: Change Security settings.


Often, code can be used to infect your computer. Avoid trouble by raising the default security level to high. Function effectively by placing oft used web sites in the ‘trusted sites’ Internet zone. Doing this will allow unrestricted viewing of most used sites.


## 10: Configure your browser security settings.


Generally, recent browsers have a lot more security features than older versions used to provide. Set basic security on high and allow only essential cookies, ban sites you don’t trust. Choose a browser you trust as well as like to use. There are many reliable options.


## 11: Secure shared files by securing and configuring the guest user account and Remember to Hit Save


Password-protect or disable the guest-user option.


Finally, be safe: always back up your data, regularly, and keep well informed of developments in the field of security.
