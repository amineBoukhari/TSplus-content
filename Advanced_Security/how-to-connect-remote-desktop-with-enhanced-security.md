## Some Important Security Steps to Take When Connecting Remote Desktop


Before diving into the specifics of securing your remote desktop connection, it is crucial to comprehend the potential risks involved. Some common vulnerabilities and threats associated with remote desktop connections are brute-force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, password cracking and unauthorized access attempts. Time to go over basic security steps to take against these.


## 1. Enforce Strong Authentication:


One of the fundamental steps in securing your remote desktop connection is implementing robust authentication mechanisms. This includes and, in fact, begins with, password-based authentication. There always reason for stressing this point.


Yet, another great addition is two-factor authentication (2FA). Certificate-based authentication, which is an integral part of most remote software nowadays, also has an important place. These items all work as a team to ward off threats rather than one by one. Each is indeed essential to remote access and control taking place securely.


## 2. Implement Network-Level Security:


To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your remote desktop traffic, implementing network-level security measures is crucial. Potential tools for this start with a sturdy network firewall. A virtual private network (VPN) is also a possibility. In cases where remote connections will be made from outside your closed network, it makes sense to consider network segmentation. Such measures will doubtless enhance the security of your remote desktop connections.


## 3. Harden the Remote Desktop Environment:


Configuring your remote desktop environment securely is essential to minimize vulnerabilities. Here are some best practices to guard your operating system: applying the latest security updates, disabling unnecessary services, configuring user access controls and implementing account lockout policies. These are essential from the outset.


We highly recommend you follow this up with a company policy encouraging the use of strong passwords. Something else to encourage is for users to regularly log out of their sessions. Simply bear in mind that insisting on doing so at too high a frequency would be burdensome for those constantly using remote sessions.


## 4. Enable Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):


As a widely used protocol Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been a historical target for attacks. Since it needs to be properly secured remember such techniques as enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), configuring encryption settings, and changing default RDP port numbers. These hide or obscure ports and provide extra gates to pass upon attempting to enter the perimeter of your network. Needless to say, they can make all the difference.


## 5. Monitor and Audit Remote Access:


Maintaining visibility into remote desktop connections is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents promptly. Hence the importance of monitoring and auditing remote access activities. Some aspects to keep watch over are log files and user sessions. Close monitoring of these can help nip certain issues in the bud. Also, implementing intrusion detection systems can enable your teams to detect and halt an attack just about in real time.
