Many businesses in the world today operate on networked systems that allow shared access to much information in order to streamline various processes. This is a wise decision by business owners as it saves a lot of time (and time is money in the world of business) that employees would otherwise spend waiting for various files to download onto their individual computer systems. **The problem is that this can also present a security nightmare for many reasons. Let's look at a few of these and at the [TSplus](https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/) solution at hand.**


## Threats to Computer Security for Businesses: Viruses


This could be the first reason to come to mind. Once one computer in the network is infected, it's a very slow business day, week, or month all around, plus in some cases an extremely expensive problem to fix. Many businesses have established policies in order to minimize these risks.


What if your business does not have a security protocol in place for not only preventing viruses but also handling the aftermath of viruses? Then, it is time to talk with your IT department or contact an IT specialist from outside the company in order to establish protocols and procedures to combat the risks that viruses pose. Indeed, they can affect both productivity and the valuable information held within your companies computer systems.


## Boosts to Computer Security for Businesses: Systems Back-ups


Regular computer systems back-ups! Here is an issue that many people do not consider when it comes to the security of computers for their businesses. However, stuff happens. Hard drives crash and servers die horrific yet spectacular deaths. The unfortunate truth is that these things never happen at opportune times (since there is never a good time for the computers of any business to go down).


The lag time however can be greatly reduced if a business creates daily backups of all computer systems. This can be done in a matter of minutes each day and can save months of highly expensive work trying to retrieve the information, should the unthinkable happen. It is well worth the costs and time involved to back up your computers each and every day as part of your company's security routine.


## Threat to IT Security for Businesses: Visitors


Most businesses have vendors and clients in and out all the time. Many of these visitors have laptop computers and need Internet access. Try to avoid allowing these visitors computers open access to the same information that your business gives to employees. Instead, it is best to have an external Internet source for visiting computers that is completely separate from the network shared by employees.


It would be wonderful if we lived in a world in which we could trust visitors but the truth is we often can't. Not only are visitors not above sabotaging the competition, many are also not above trying to steal secrets, let alone the new product in the pipeline. For this reason, it is wise to invest in an internal network and an external network for your business.


## Hurdle to Computer Security for Businesses: Remote Access


This is something that many companies offer employees as a way of allowing them to work from home on occasion during family emergencies and even after-hours. Many employees see this as a perk and more and more businesses are allowing this sort of access. The problem is that not all employees are as security conscious as they should be. You may be glad to know [TSplus](https://tsplus.net/) software is basically very secure software for Remote Work, Application publishing and so on, and that we have developed a great set of tools to make it even safer for your company and users.


Discuss with the IT experts in your company or those you consult how to minimize the risks involved in providing this 'perk' to employees. There are ways that can be incorporated which limit the information accessible to individual employees while they work remotely but still allow them to access the files that are relevant to their specific tasks and responsibilities via a password or code.
