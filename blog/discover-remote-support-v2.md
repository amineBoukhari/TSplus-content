Earlier this year, TSplus announced the release of TSplus Remote Support â€“ a secure and easy to use, browser-based Windows screen sharing and remote-control tool. The feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive. That feedback also included ways we can do better.  
  
You spoke. We listened.  
  
Today we are proud to announce the release of TSplus Remote Support Version 2! We've added an array of new features:  
  


* **Unattended Access** - When configured, unattended access gives your support team easy access to end-user PCs, even if the end-user isn't at their computer!
* **Remote Computer list management** - Support Agents can now arrange their list of remote computers into groups for easy searching.
* **Added Languages** - Translations of the Web Console and Client have been added for our French, German and Portuguese customers.

  
That's just a highlight of the new features and functionality in Version 2 of Remote Support. To learn more about the great upgrades, easy use and budget-friendly licensing, please visit the Remote Support website. While you're there, take a moment to download the 15 day free trial and test it with your support team!  
  
Thank you!
